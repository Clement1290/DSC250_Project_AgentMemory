I¡¯ve been feeling a bit distant in our relationship lately.  
I¡¯ve noticed, and it worries me. Can we talk about what¡¯s been bothering you?  
I think I¡¯ve been caught up in my own thoughts and haven¡¯t been as present.  
I appreciate you sharing that with me. It¡¯s important to me that we¡¯re both present.  
I just feel like we¡¯re getting lost in our routines.  
I understand, routines can sometimes overshadow the connection we have.  
What can we do together to reconnect?  
Maybe we could set aside specific times just for us, like date nights.  
I love that idea! We should prioritize our time together again.  
Absolutely. I want to feel close to you again.  
Me too. It¡¯s hard when life gets busy, but you¡¯re my priority.  
Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me.  
I just want us to feel like we¡¯re on the same team.  
Right, supporting each other is key. How can I support you better?  
I¡¯d love more open communication about what we¡¯re feeling.  
I can do that. I want you to feel heard and valued in this relationship.  
I appreciate your willingness to listen. It makes me feel so much closer to you.  
Let¡¯s also share more of our daily experiences, the little things.  
That sounds great! I want to know everything that matters to you.  
So, what little moments have you been missing that we can focus on?  
Honestly, just sharing our thoughts at the end of the day, like we used to.  
How can we recreate those end-of-day chats that meant so much to us back then?
