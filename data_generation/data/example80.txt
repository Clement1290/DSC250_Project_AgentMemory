How has school been treating you lately?  
It's been a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I feel like I'm drowning in assignments.  
I totally get that; it can be really tough sometimes. Have you been taking breaks?  
Not really, I just keep pushing through. I feel guilty if I take time off.  
You shouldn't feel guilty for taking care of yourself. Rest is important for your mental health!  
I know, but it feels like there's so much pressure to keep up.  
It's okay to prioritize your well-being. Maybe set a small timer for breaks?  
That¡¯s a good idea, but I often get caught up in my work.  
Maybe try to schedule your breaks into your routine? It'll be easier if it's planned.  
That makes sense. I could use an alarm to remind me to take those breaks.  
Definitely, and don¡¯t forget to reward yourself after completing tasks.  
I like that idea! It feels like I'm always working, though.  
You deserve to enjoy your hard work, even if it's just a little treat.  
True, I should probably allow myself some small victories.  
Small victories add up and help build confidence, especially in school.  
I think I've been too hard on myself lately, trying to be perfect.  
Perfection is impossible; it's more about doing your best and learning.  
That¡¯s so true. I just want to make my family proud.  
They will be proud of your efforts, no matter the outcome. It's about growth.  
Thanks for reminding me! I should focus on that more often.  
Of course! So, what's your plan to tackle the workload while being kinder to yourself?  
I'm thinking of starting with a study schedule and incorporating regular breaks, just like you suggested at the beginning.
