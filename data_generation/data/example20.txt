I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I understand, it¡¯s tough when everything piles up. What¡¯s been bothering you the most?  
It¡¯s just the constant deadlines and feeling like I¡¯m not keeping up.  
That sounds really stressful. Have you had a chance to talk to your manager about it?  
Not really, I¡¯m worried they¡¯ll think I can¡¯t handle my responsibilities.  
I get that, but it¡¯s okay to ask for help sometimes. You¡¯re not alone in this.  
I know, but it feels like everyone else is managing just fine.  
Comparison can be so draining. Remember, everyone has their struggles, even if they don¡¯t show it.  
You¡¯re right. I just wish I could find a way to balance everything better.  
Have you tried breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable parts?  
No, I haven¡¯t. That might help me feel less stressed.  
It could definitely give you a clearer picture and make it feel less daunting.  
Thanks for the suggestion! Sometimes I just need someone to remind me of simple strategies.  
Of course! I¡¯m always here to help you work through it. How are you feeling about sharing your workload?  
I think it would relieve some pressure, but I¡¯m nervous about asking for help.  
It¡¯s totally natural to feel that way, but remember that collaboration can lead to better outcomes.  
That makes sense. It might also give others a chance to pitch in and share the load.  
Exactly! You¡¯re part of a team, and it¡¯s okay to lean on each other.  
I¡¯ll try to reach out tomorrow. Thanks for encouraging me to do so.  
You¡¯re welcome! I¡¯m proud of you for taking that step. Do you feel more confident about addressing your workload now?  
Yes, thinking it through has helped. Just like you reminded me at the start, breaking things down can really change the perspective.
