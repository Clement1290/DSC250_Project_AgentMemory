How are you feeling about us lately?  
I've been a bit worried, honestly. It feels like we've been drifting apart.  
I can see that. I¡¯ve felt it too, and I think we need to talk about it openly.  
I appreciate you saying that. Sometimes I wonder if we¡¯re communicating enough about what we need.  
That's a good point. I often worry that my needs might be overwhelming for you.  
You¡¯re never overwhelming. I just want to ensure we're both comfortable sharing our emotions.  
That means a lot to me. I guess I sometimes hesitate because I don¡¯t want to seem needy.  
It¡¯s okay to feel needy sometimes. We¡¯re a team, and we should lean on each other when we need support.  
You¡¯re right. I think I need to work on expressing my feelings more often.  
I think openness can really strengthen our bond. What can I do to help with that?  
Just being there to listen when I share would be a huge help. I often need reassurance.  
Of course, I¡¯ll always make time for you. It¡¯s important for both of us to feel heard.  
Thank you for being so understanding. It makes me feel safer to open up.  
I care about your feelings more than anything. We're in this together, remember?  
I do. Sometimes I just need a reminder that we¡¯re both committed to making this work.  
Absolutely! Commitment means weathering the storms together, definitely.  
I like that analogy. So, what can we do to weather these storms better?  
We might try having regular check-ins about how we¡¯re both feeling. What do you think?  
That sounds like a great idea! It could help us stay connected and address issues sooner.  
I¡¯m glad you think so! So, how do you feel about having our first check-in soon?  
I¡¯d love that! It would be a great way to ensure we¡¯re both feeling secure in our relationship.
