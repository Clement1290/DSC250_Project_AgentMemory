I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about what¡¯s been weighing you down?  
I think it¡¯s just the workload piling up and deadlines approaching. It feels endless.  
That sounds tough. Have you had a chance to discuss this with your manager?  
Not really. I¡¯m worried they might think I can¡¯t handle it.  
It¡¯s understandable to feel that way, but asking for help is a sign of strength.  
Yeah, I know. I just don¡¯t want to come off as incompetent.  
You¡¯re not incompetent; you¡¯re human. Everyone has their limits.  
That¡¯s true. It¡¯s just hard to remember that when I¡¯m in the thick of it.  
Maybe you could try breaking your tasks down into smaller, manageable parts?  
That¡¯s a good idea! I often feel smaller tasks are more achievable.  
Exactly! Plus, each little accomplishment can boost your morale.  
I really appreciate your support. It helps to share this with someone.  
Of course, I¡¯m here for you. You don¡¯t have to go through this alone.  
Thanks! I think I¡¯ll try to set some boundaries this week.  
That sounds like a great plan. What boundaries are you thinking of setting?  
I want to limit my work hours and take some time for myself each day.  
That¡¯s very important. Self-care can improve your productivity too.  
I¡¯ve been neglecting that part of my life, to be honest.  
It¡¯s easy to do when work gets busy. Make sure to prioritize yourself.  
You¡¯re right. I¡¯ll put that on my to-do list. Can we check in next week?  
Of course! I¡¯d love to hear how those boundaries have treated you.
