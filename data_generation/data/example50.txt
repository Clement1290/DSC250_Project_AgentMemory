I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. What do you think is causing the overwhelm?  
I think it¡¯s just the massive workload and tight deadlines.  
That sounds tough. Have you had a chance to talk to your manager about it?  
Not yet. I don¡¯t want to seem like I can¡¯t handle it.  
I understand, but asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It¡¯s okay to express your needs.  
You¡¯re right. I just fear they¡¯ll think I¡¯m not capable.  
Remember, everyone needs support sometimes. It¡¯s about teamwork.  
That¡¯s true. Maybe I¡¯ll draft an email to my manager today.  
That sounds like a great idea! How are you feeling about that?  
A bit nervous, to be honest, but I know it¡¯s necessary.  
Just take a deep breath. You deserve to have a manageable workload.  
Thanks for the encouragement. I really appreciate it.  
Of course! Have you considered what specific changes you might ask for?  
Yes, I think I need a clearer prioritization of tasks and maybe an extension on a few deadlines.  
That sounds reasonable. It¡¯s important to communicate your needs clearly.  
I¡¯ll try to be straightforward and honest. I feel like it could help.  
Definitely. It¡¯s all about setting healthy boundaries and expectations.  
I¡¯m realizing that I can¡¯t do it all alone.  
Exactly! Collaborative effort can lead to better outcomes at work.  
So, once I send the email, how do you think I should follow up with my manager?  
You could ask for a meeting to discuss your workload in detail, just like we talked about at the beginning.
