How have you been feeling about work lately?  
It's been pretty overwhelming, to be honest. I feel like I'm constantly under pressure.  
That sounds really tough. What do you think is causing that pressure?  
I think it's a mix of deadlines and not having enough support from my team.  
I can understand how that would feel isolating. Have you talked to anyone about it?  
Not really, I've been afraid of burdening them with my problems.  
You shouldn¡¯t feel that way; it¡¯s important to share what you're going through.  
You're right. Maybe I need to open up more, but I'm worried about how they'll react.  
It's natural to feel that way, but a good team should support each other.  
I hope so. It's just hard to break that barrier sometimes.  
Maybe you could start with someone you trust?  
That¡¯s a good idea. I feel like I have to take that first step somehow.  
Yes, and it might surprise you how much others relate to what you're feeling.  
That thought is comforting. I really don¡¯t want to be a nuisance, though.  
You¡¯re not a nuisance; everyone goes through tough times. It's part of being human.  
Thanks for reminding me of that. It helps to know that I'm not alone.  
Of course! Just make sure to check in on your own feelings too, okay?  
I will; sometimes I forget to take care of myself in the midst of it all.  
Self-care is crucial, especially when work is demanding.  
Absolutely. Do you have any tips on balancing both?  
You could try setting aside time in your day just for you, even if it¡¯s short.  
That sounds manageable! How did you find that balance in your own life?  
In the beginning, I struggled too, but I learned to prioritize my mental health.  
So, looking back to when we started talking about work, do you feel more ready to reach out for support?
