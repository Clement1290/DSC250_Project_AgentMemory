I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. What¡¯s been weighing on you the most?  
It¡¯s just the constant deadlines and the pressure to perform.  
That sounds really tough. It¡¯s important to remember to take breaks, though.  
I know, but it feels like there¡¯s no time to relax.  
Making time, even small moments, might help ease some stress.  
You¡¯re right. I just get so caught up in my tasks.  
Have you thought about sharing your workload with teammates?  
I haven¡¯t really. I guess I¡¯m afraid they¡¯ll judge me for not handling it.  
I understand that fear, but most colleagues are willing to help if you ask.  
True, and I know I shouldn¡¯t feel ashamed. It¡¯s just hard for me.  
It¡¯s completely normal to feel that way. You're human, after all.  
Thanks for saying that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this.  
Of course! Have you considered talking to your manager about your feelings?  
I¡¯ve thought about it, but I¡¯m worried they won¡¯t understand.  
That¡¯s understandable, but open communication can lead to positive changes.  
Yeah, I really need to find a way to express my challenges without feeling vulnerable.  
Maybe practicing what you want to say could lessen that vulnerability?  
That¡¯s a good idea! I¡¯ll try to articulate my thoughts clearly.  
Great! Remember, it¡¯s okay to seek support when you need it.  
I will, thank you for being so understanding. It really means a lot.  
How are you planning to initiate that conversation with your manager about your workload?
