"Hey, I noticed you've been a bit stressed about school lately. Is everything alright?"  
"Yeah, it's just that the exams are coming up, and I'm feeling overwhelmed with the study load."  
"I completely understand. It can be so tough. Have you thought about making a study schedule to help manage your time?"  
"I did, but I keep getting distracted. It's hard to focus with everything going on."  
"Distractions can be really challenging. Maybe we could find a quiet place to study together? Sometimes having someone there helps."  
"That's a great idea! I feel more motivated when I'm not alone, but I didn't think of that."  
"I'm glad you like it! Also, remember to take breaks. Pushing too hard can make it harder to concentrate."  
"True, I often forget to take breaks and just keep going until I'm exhausted."  
"How about we set a timer? Work for a certain time and then take a short break?"  
"I like that! It'll keep me from getting burned out. Thanks for suggesting it."  
"Of course! I'm here for you. Have you been able to ask the teacher for help on topics you're struggling with?"  
"I haven't yet. I feel embarrassed to ask questions in front of everyone."  
"There's no need to feel embarrassed. Most students have questions too, and teachers appreciate when you seek help."  
"That's a good point. I should push myself to ask for help when I need it."  
"Definitely! We're all learning, and it's okay not to know everything. You're doing great just by trying."  
"Thanks! Your support really makes a difference. I feel less anxious talking about it."  
"I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to share your feelings, especially when things get tough."  
"I'll keep that in mind. I guess I just need to be more open about what I'm going through."  
"Absolutely. And I'll be here to listen whenever you need someone to talk to."  
"Thanks so much! It's comforting to know I have you to lean on during this stressful time."  
"Anytime! So, have you thought about how you can balance your study schedule with asking for help without feeling overwhelmed?"
