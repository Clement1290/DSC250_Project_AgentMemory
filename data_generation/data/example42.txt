"Hey, how are you feeling about the upcoming school year?"  
"I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. There¡¯s so much pressure to perform well."  
"I totally understand that. It can be overwhelming sometimes."  
"I just worry about keeping up with everything. What if I fall behind?"  
"You're not alone in feeling that way! It¡¯s okay to reach out for help."  
"Thanks, that makes me feel a little better. Do you think I should talk to a teacher?"  
"Definitely! They can offer support and guidance. Plus, it shows you're proactive."  
"Yeah, you're right. I just hate the thought of admitting I need help."  
"That¡¯s a common feeling, but asking for help shows strength, not weakness."  
"I guess so. What if they think I¡¯m not capable?"  
"Trust me, teachers appreciate honesty and commitment. They'll respect you for it."  
"Okay, that makes sense. What about my friends? What if they see me struggling?"  
"True friends won¡¯t judge you for needing support, they¡¯ll be there for you."  
"I hope so. I value their opinions a lot."  
"Friendship is about lifting each other up, especially during tough times."  
"That¡¯s comforting to hear. Sometimes I feel so isolated in my worries."  
"Remember, we all have our battles. Sharing can lighten the load."  
"I'll try to open up more. It¡¯s just hard to be vulnerable."  
"That¡¯s completely understandable. Just take it one step at a time."  
"How do you stay so calm about school? Any tips?"  
"I focus on what I can control and try not to dwell on the ¡®what ifs.¡¯"  
"That¡¯s great advice. Do you think this approach will help me when school starts?"
