How have you been feeling about our family's situation lately?  
I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, honestly. There's just so much going on with everyone.  
I completely understand. It does feel like everyone is facing their own challenges right now.  
Yes, it¡¯s hard to see them struggle. I wish I could help more.  
You do help just by being there for them; your support means a lot.  
Thanks, that really means a lot to me. I sometimes doubt my ability to make a difference.  
It's normal to feel that way. Just remember, sometimes being a good listener is all they need.  
You're right. I just wish I knew how to address their problems more directly.  
Maybe it starts with simple conversations; check in with them one at a time.  
That's a good point. I just fear I won't say the right thing and make things worse.  
It's okay to not have all the answers. It shows that you care, and that goes a long way.  
True, I guess being honest about my feelings can open up the conversation.  
Exactly! It can encourage them to share their burdens, too.  
I¡¯ll try to reach out to them more often. I know they've been isolating themselves.  
That¡¯s a great plan! They probably need someone to remind them they¡¯re not alone.  
I¡¯ll make sure to show them that I¡¯m here no matter what.  
You¡¯re such a wonderful sibling; your love will always shine through.  
Thank you, that really encourages me. I just hope this brings us all closer together.  
It will; vulnerability often strengthens family bonds.  
I¡¯m really hoping we can support each other through this challenging time.  
Speaking of support, what¡¯s the one thing you think we could all do together as a family to strengthen our connection again?
