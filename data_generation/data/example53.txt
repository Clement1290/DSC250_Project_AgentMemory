How have you been feeling about our relationship lately?  
I¡¯ve been feeling a bit distant, like we¡¯re not as connected as we used to be.  
I understand, and I've been sensing that too. Do you think it's because of our busy schedules?  
Definitely, it's like we hardly have time for each other. I miss our late-night talks.  
Me too! Those moments really brought us closer. Can we set aside some time just for us?  
Yes, I¡¯d love that. Maybe we could have a date night this weekend?  
That sounds perfect! I think we need to reconnect and talk about what we¡¯ve been feeling.  
Absolutely. It¡¯s important to share those emotions. What¡¯s been weighing on your mind the most?  
I worry that we might be drifting apart and that scares me. I value what we have.  
I feel the same way! It's tough to acknowledge but I know we can work through it together.  
Yes, I believe open communication will help us a lot. We should always feel safe sharing our feelings.  
Exactly! I want us to feel comfortable being vulnerable with each other.  
And I think reassessing our priorities together could really help. What do you think?  
That's a great idea! It¡¯s vital that we¡¯re on the same page moving forward.  
Right. Let¡¯s make it a priority to check in with each other regularly.  
For sure! I want us to create an emotional space where we can both express our needs.  
That would be so helpful. I feel noticed and cared for when you do that.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that! It makes me feel connected to you as well.  
How do you usually feel when we communicate openly like this?  
It makes me feel safe and valued. It reminds me of how important our relationship is.  
Do you think we can make a habit of this kind of check-in to prevent distance in the future?  
Yes, definitely! I want to ensure we always feel close, just like when we used to chat for hours.
