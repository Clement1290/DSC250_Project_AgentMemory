How have you been feeling about our relationship lately?  
I¡¯ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, honestly. I think we need to talk more.  
I can sense that. What¡¯s been weighing on your mind?  
I just feel like we haven't really connected emotionally in a while.  
I understand that. I've noticed we've been busy with life and haven't prioritized us.  
Exactly! I miss those deep conversations we used to have.  
Me too. What do you think we can do to bring that back?  
Maybe we could set aside some time each week just for us?  
I love that idea. What activities do you think would help us reconnect?  
We could try cooking dinner together or just going for long walks.  
That sounds perfect! I remember when we enjoyed doing that.  
Yes! Those times always made me feel so close to you.  
I cherish those memories. They remind me of how strong we are together.  
Definitely. Do you think we can tackle any issues we¡¯ve been avoiding as well?  
Yes, I think it would help clear the air. What do you feel we need to address?  
I sometimes feel like my feelings aren't being understood.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. I truly want to understand you better.  
Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me.  
Let's promise to communicate openly about our feelings moving forward.  
Absolutely! I want both of us to feel secure and heard in this relationship.  
What steps can we take, starting today, to ensure we both feel connected?  
Let¡¯s start with spending some quality time together tonight, like we used to.
