I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately.  
I¡¯m really sorry to hear that. Want to talk about what¡¯s been bothering you?  
I just have so many projects piling up, and I don¡¯t feel like I can keep up.  
That sounds really tough. Have you thought about breaking them down into smaller tasks?  
I have, but even small tasks feel like too much right now.  
It¡¯s completely understandable to feel that way. Sometimes when we¡¯re overwhelmed, it helps to take a step back.  
I guess I could try to focus on one thing at a time, but I¡¯m still worried about the deadlines.  
Deadlines can be stressful, but remember, prioritizing is key. What¡¯s your most pressing task right now?  
It¡¯s the presentation for the team meeting next week. I¡¯m worried it won¡¯t be good enough.  
I believe in you. You¡¯ve always put together great presentations. Maybe start with an outline?  
That might help. It¡¯s just that I don¡¯t want to let my team down.  
It¡¯s clear you care a lot about your team, which is a strength. Have you shared your thoughts with them?  
Not really. I don¡¯t want to seem like I¡¯m making excuses.  
I understand that, but being open could foster collaboration and support. You¡¯re not alone in this.  
That¡¯s true. Sometimes I forget that. I guess everyone has their own struggles.  
Exactly! A little vulnerability can build stronger relationships. Have you thought about delegating some tasks?  
I¡¯ve been hesitant to ask for help, but maybe I should. I just worry about burdening others.  
It¡¯s not a burden; collaboration is part of teamwork. People appreciate being asked for help.  
You¡¯re right. I¡¯ll try to reach out to some teammates. Thanks for encouraging me!  
Of course! How are you feeling about the presentation now?  
I feel a bit more relieved thinking about getting help, but it¡¯s still a bit daunting.  
That¡¯s a positive step! Just remember, taking it one piece at a time will make it manageable.  
I appreciate that. It helps to talk about it and have someone listen.  
I¡¯m glad I could be here for you. Is there anything specific you want to focus on for the presentation?  
Actually, I think going over my ideas with a colleague might solidify them. Do you think I should ask someone tomorrow?  
Absolutely! That¡¯s a great idea. Who do you think would be the best to approach?  
I¡¯m considering Jenna, as she¡¯s really creative and always offers constructive feedback.  
That sounds like a perfect choice! You¡¯ve always admired her input from the start, right?
