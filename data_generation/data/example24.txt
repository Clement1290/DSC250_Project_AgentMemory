"Hey, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with school lately."  
"I'm sorry to hear that. What specifically is bothering you?"  
"Honestly, I¡¯m struggling to keep up with all the assignments and tests."  
"That sounds really tough. Have you thought about talking to a teacher or someone for help?"  
"I have, but I¡¯m not sure how to approach them without seeming weak."  
"It's totally normal to ask for help, and it shows strength to recognize when you need support."  
"Thanks, I appreciate you saying that. Sometimes I just feel so alone in all this."  
"You're definitely not alone. We all have our own battles, and it's okay to lean on each other."  
"That¡¯s true. I guess I just hate feeling like I'm falling behind."  
"Falling behind is hard, but remember, it¡¯s okay to take one step at a time."  
"Yeah, I just wish I could find a way to catch up without stressing out."  
"Have you tried breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces?"  
"Not really. I usually just look at everything as one big mountain."  
"Maybe creating a schedule could help you see things more clearly."  
"That might work! It¡¯s hard to think of it that way when I¡¯m in the thick of it."  
"Totally understandable. Sometimes we need to shift our perspective to see a way out."  
"Thanks for helping me to look at it differently. I really needed that."  
"Of course! We're friends, and I'm here for you. How can I further support you?"  
"Maybe just checking in with me from time to time would help."  
"Absolutely! I¡¯ll check in regularly. When are you feeling the most stressed?"  
"It¡¯s usually right before assignments are due. Do you think it¡¯ll get easier?"  
"I believe it can, especially if you keep working on managing your tasks like we discussed. Do you feel ready to tackle your first big assignment now?"
