"Hey, how are you handling all this school pressure lately?"  
"I've been feeling really overwhelmed with the assignments and exams. It¡¯s a lot to juggle."  
"I totally understand. It seems like teachers don¡¯t realize how much they pile on sometimes."  
"Right? I feel like I¡¯m drowning under all this work. It¡¯s hard to keep my head above water."  
"Have you thought about taking breaks? Sometimes just stepping away for a bit helps clear your head."  
"I try that, but I end up worrying about what I¡¯m missing instead of enjoying the break."  
"That¡¯s tough. Maybe we can help each other? I could study with you to make it less stressful."  
"That sounds great! I always feel more motivated when I¡¯m not doing it alone."  
"Plus, we can remind each other to take breaks. It¡¯s important for our mental health."  
"Yes! I need that balance. I don't want to burn out before the semester ends."  
"Exactly. And if things get too much, we can always talk about it. I¡¯m here for you."  
"Thanks, I appreciate that. It feels good to know I have someone in my corner."  
"Of course! Remember, it's okay to express when things get heavy. You¡¯re not alone."  
"It's just hard for me sometimes to open up. I worry about being a burden."  
"You could never be a burden! We all have our moments, and it's normal to need support."  
"That makes me feel better. I¡¯ll try to share more when I'm feeling down."  
"I¡¯ll do the same! Let¡¯s create an environment where we can be honest about our struggles."  
"Absolutely. That would make such a difference. I just want to get through this."  
"Same here. Just think¡ªonce we push through, we can relax and enjoy the break!"  
"Do you think we¡¯ll still be able to help each other out even when school gets super hectic?"  
"I¡¯m sure we will! It's all about sticking together like we talked about from the start."
