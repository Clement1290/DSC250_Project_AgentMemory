I¡¯ve been feeling overwhelmed with work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. What¡¯s been bothering you the most?  
It¡¯s just the deadlines piling up and the pressure to perform.  
That sounds really tough. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about it?  
Not really. I don¡¯t want to burden my colleagues.  
I understand, but sometimes sharing can lighten the load.  
You¡¯re right. I just worry about adding stress to others.  
It¡¯s okay to be vulnerable. We all face challenges at work.  
True, but it¡¯s hard to admit when I¡¯m struggling.  
Absolutely, but you¡¯re not alone in this. I¡¯m here to listen.  
Thank you! I feel a little better just talking about it.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that. What specifically are you struggling with?  
It¡¯s mostly managing my time effectively. I feel like I¡¯m constantly behind.  
That¡¯s a common issue. Have you tried breaking your tasks into smaller pieces?  
Not really, I tend to look at the bigger picture and get overwhelmed.  
That makes sense. Focusing on smaller tasks can make it feel more manageable.  
I see your point. It might help to prioritize better too.  
Definitely! Maybe setting some daily goals could work for you.  
I like that idea. I¡¯ll try to set more realistic expectations for myself.  
That¡¯s a great step! Remember, it¡¯s okay to ask for help when you need it.  
I appreciate your support. How do you manage when work gets overwhelming?  
I try to remember to check in with myself, just like you mentioned in the beginning.
