"Hey, I noticed you've been a bit quiet in class lately. Is everything okay?"  
"Thanks for asking. I've been feeling pretty stressed about the upcoming exams."  
"I completely understand. Exams can be really overwhelming. Do you want to talk about what subjects are stressing you out the most?"  
"Math has been tough for me this semester. I just can't seem to grasp some of the concepts."  
"Math can be tricky! Have you thought about getting a tutor or joining a study group?"  
"I thought about it, but I feel embarrassed about needing help."  
"You shouldn't feel embarrassed. Everyone needs help sometimes, and it shows strength to seek it out."  
"That's true. I just worry that people will judge me for not understanding."  
"Your friends care about you and what you're going through. They'd want to support you."  
"I guess you're right. I just want to do well and not let anyone down."  
"It's okay to feel that pressure, but remember that your worth isn't tied to grades. It's about your effort."  
"Thanks. That makes me feel a little better. I¡¯ll try to focus on doing my best, not just the results."  
"Exactly! And remember, it's okay to make mistakes¡ªthey're part of the learning process."  
"Yeah, I need to remind myself of that. Also, I'm worried about the presentations coming up."  
"Presentations can be nerve-wracking. Would practicing together help ease your anxiety?"  
"That could really help! I always feel better when I practice with someone else."  
"Let¡¯s set up a practice session. I can help you work through your points."  
"Thank you! That would make a huge difference. I always feel less scared when I¡¯m prepared."  
"I'm glad to hear that! Preparation really helps. What's your topic for the presentation?"  
"I'm presenting on climate change. It¡¯s such a big issue, and I want to do it justice."  
"That¡¯s an important topic! You¡¯ll do great if you focus on your passion for it."  
"Thanks for believing in me! Just like you believed I could tackle the math¡ªI¡¯ll remember that."
