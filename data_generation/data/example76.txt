"Hey, how are you feeling about the upcoming exams?"  
"I'm really anxious, I don't think I'm going to do well."  
"Have you been studying enough? Sometimes it helps to talk it out."  
"I try, but I get overwhelmed with the material and just freeze."  
"That¡¯s completely understandable. How about we go over some topics together?"  
"I¡¯d really appreciate that. Studying alone just adds to my stress."  
"Of course! Let¡¯s break it down into smaller sections. What subjects do you feel least confident in?"  
"Math is my weakest point. I'm worried I'm going to blank out during the test."  
"Let¡¯s focus on some practice problems together. I can help explain things."  
"Thank you! That really means a lot to me. I feel less alone."  
"I¡¯m here for you. We can do this as a team! When do you want to start?"  
"Maybe tomorrow after school? I can bring some snacks to make it more enjoyable."  
"That sounds perfect! Snacks make everything better! What kind do you have in mind?"  
"I was thinking of bringing some cookies and maybe some fruit."  
"Great choice! Cookies are always a good study companion. Do you have a favorite kind?"  
"Chocolate chip for sure. They make studying a lot more bearable!"  
"I agree! It¡¯s nice to have something to look forward to while studying."  
"Exactly! And it gives us a little break to chat and relax too."  
"Definitely! It¡¯s important to balance study with some fun. We¡¯ll make it work."  
"Thanks for being so supportive. I feel much better having a study buddy."  
"I wouldn't want it any other way! Do you think having us study together will help with your exam nerves?"
