"Hey, how are you feeling about the exams coming up?"  
"I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I really want to do well."  
"I understand, it can be overwhelming. Have you been studying much?"  
"Yeah, I've been trying, but sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress."  
"It's completely normal to feel that way. What subjects do you think are the most challenging for you?"  
"I think math is really tough for me this time. I just can¡¯t seem to grasp some of the concepts."  
"Have you thought about asking a teacher for some extra help? They can be really understanding."  
"I have, but I feel embarrassed to admit I'm struggling."  
"Don't be embarrassed! They want to help you succeed. Remember, asking for help is a strength, not a weakness."  
"I guess you're right. Maybe I can talk to my math teacher tomorrow."  
"That's a great idea! And I can help you go through some math problems after school if you want."  
"That would be really nice of you. I appreciate your support."  
"Of course! We all need a little help sometimes. How about those other subjects?"  
"I'm feeling okay about English and history, but I'm still a bit anxious."  
"Is there anything specific you're anxious about in those subjects?"  
"Mainly the essays. I always worry if I'm writing what the teacher wants."  
"Would it help to create an outline together for your essays? That way, you can feel more structured."  
"Yes, that sounds really helpful! Thank you for suggesting it."  
"Anytime! This is a team effort, and I¡¯m here for you. Do you feel like you¡¯re handling the stress okay?"  
"Some days are better than others, but your support really helps. Speaking of which, how do you feel about your exams?"  
"Oh, I¡¯ve been stressed too, especially about science. Remember how we talked about those subjects at the beginning?"
