"Hey, how was your day at school today?"  
"It was okay, but I really struggled with math class again."  
"Math can be tough. What specifically is causing you trouble?"  
"I just can't seem to grasp the new concepts."  
"I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried asking your teacher for help?"  
"Not really, I feel embarrassed asking in front of everyone."  
"That's understandable, but teachers are there to help you. You could ask for some extra help after class."  
"Maybe, but what if I still don¡¯t get it? I don't want to feel dumb."  
"Feeling confused doesn¡¯t mean you¡¯re dumb; it just means you're learning. It's okay to take your time."  
"I guess so. But sometimes I feel like I'm falling behind."  
"It's okay to feel that way. You can always catch up; it's not a race."  
"Thanks for saying that. It just helps to know I¡¯m not alone in this."  
"Absolutely! I¡¯m here for you, and we can study together if you want."  
"That would be nice. I could use some support."  
"Of course! We can make it fun¡ªit doesn't have to be all stress."  
"I like that idea. It makes me feel more motivated."  
"Great! Just remember, it's important to be kind to yourself during tough times."  
"I will try to be more patient with myself. I just want to do well."  
"And you will, just take it one step at a time. What's your favorite subject, by the way?"  
"Science! I love learning about living things."  
"That's awesome! Maybe we can use that interest to make math easier for you."  
"Yeah, like using examples from science to understand math!"  
"Exactly! So, are you feeling a bit better about tackling that math challenge now?"
