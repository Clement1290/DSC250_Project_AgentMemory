I'm feeling really anxious about my upcoming exams.  
I understand, exams can be really stressful. What specifically worries you the most?  
I guess I¡¯m concerned about not being able to remember anything during the test.  
Have you tried any study techniques that help you retain information better?  
I¡¯ve tried flashcards, but sometimes I forget to use them regularly.  
Maybe setting a daily study schedule could help you stay on track with your flashcards?  
That sounds like a good idea. I just need to stick to it.  
What¡¯s your favorite subject and why does it stress you out the most?  
I really love math, but I always feel pressured to get a perfect score.  
It's great that you enjoy math! Remember, it¡¯s okay not to be perfect. What matters is understanding the concepts.  
That¡¯s true. I just feel like everyone expects me to excel.  
It¡¯s tough when you feel that pressure. Have you talked to anyone about it?  
Not really, I don't want to burden my friends with my worries.  
Your friends might appreciate you opening up; it could strengthen your bond. Would it feel okay for you to share?  
Maybe. I just worry they won¡¯t know how to help me.  
Sometimes just listening is all someone needs. They might have felt similar pressure too.  
You¡¯re right. Maybe I¡¯ll try talking to one of them.  
That sounds like a good plan! And how about setting aside time to relax?  
I could do that. I often forget to take breaks while studying.  
Taking breaks is important for your mind, it helps to recharge. Do you have any favorite activities to unwind?  
I enjoy drawing; it helps me relax and clear my mind.  
That¡¯s wonderful! Maybe you can sketch a bit after your study sessions as a reward.  
I¡¯ll try that! I think it¡¯ll motivate me to stick to my schedule.  
How do you feel about tackling your exam preparations together, maybe setting study goals?  
I¡¯d love that! It would be great to have support. Would you want me to check in on your study schedule?
