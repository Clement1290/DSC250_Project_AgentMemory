"Hey, how was school today? I noticed you seemed a bit off when you got home."  
"I had a tough day. Some kids were teasing me about my new glasses."  
"I'm really sorry to hear that. It's never easy when people are mean."  
"Thanks, it just hurts sometimes, you know? I thought I'd get used to them, but..."  
"You're still adjusting, and that's okay. Glasses can be hard to get used to, especially if they feel different."  
"Yeah, I just feel like I stand out too much now."  
"But standing out can be a good thing! It shows your uniqueness."  
"I guess, but it's hard to see it that way when everyone has something to say."  
"True, but remember that their opinions don¡¯t define who you are."  
"I appreciate that, but it still feels lonely."  
"You're not alone. I'm here for you, and I think your glasses look great."  
"Thanks for saying that. It means a lot coming from you."  
"Of course! Do you want to talk about anything else? Maybe something fun?"  
"Maybe... How about that new project we have for art class?"  
"That sounds good! I hear it's about designing our own dream school."  
"Yes! I have some ideas about how I want my school to look."  
"I'm curious! What are you thinking so far?"  
"I want it to have a huge library filled with cozy corners to read."  
"Ooh, that sounds amazing! A perfect escape from the hustle of school."  
"I know, right? We should both design places we wish we had at our school."  
"Definitely! And maybe you can make a special corner just for glasses-wearers like us."  
"That would be so cool! Do you think we can make it happen in our designs?"
