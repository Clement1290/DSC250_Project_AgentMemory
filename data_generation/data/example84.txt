How are you feeling about the upcoming school year?  
I'm feeling a little anxious; it's always hard to adjust.  
I understand. Starting over can be tough. What specifically worries you?  
Mostly, it's meeting new people and keeping up with my classes.  
That makes sense. Have you thought about joining any clubs to help with the social aspect?  
Yeah, I was thinking of trying out for the drama club; I love acting!  
That's a great idea! Acting can really help break the ice with others.  
Exactly! But what if I don't make it? That thought scares me.  
It's normal to worry, but remember that it's about having fun, not just winning.  
True, but I always worry that I'll embarrass myself in front of everyone.  
You're not alone in feeling that way; many people share your fear.  
Thanks for saying that. It helps to know I'm not the only one.  
Of course! Have you talked to any friends about it?  
Not yet. I don¡¯t want to burden them with my worries.  
They might appreciate your honesty; it could bring you closer together.  
You're right. I should reach out. What else can I do to feel better?  
Maybe practice some monologues at home to build your confidence?  
That sounds smart! I could definitely use some practice.  
And remember to be kind to yourself; everyone has their insecurities.  
I will, thanks! Support from friends and practicing will help a lot.  
Speaking of friends, do you think they'll understand if I need some extra help?  
Absolutely! Friends want to support each other, especially in challenging times.  
I'm really relieved to hear you say that. Can we talk about school events again later?  
Sure! I'm here anytime. It¡¯s important to stay connected as the year goes on.  
How do you think those feelings of anxiety will change after the first few days?
