How have you been feeling about our relationship lately?  
I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed; sometimes I wonder if we're really communicating well.  
I get that, and I've sensed some distance too. What's been weighing on your mind?  
I think it's just the busy schedules we have. It makes me feel like we're not prioritizing each other.

Maybe we could set aside a regular date night? Just you and me like we used to.  
I love that idea! It's so important to reconnect. What else do you think we could do?  
We could also start texting or calling more during the day just to check in.  
Absolutely! Small gestures can really help maintain our bond. How has work been for you?  
It's been hectic, but I try to remind myself to balance it all. I want us to stay strong despite the chaos.  
I appreciate that mindset! It shows how committed you are. Do you think we also need to talk about our future?

I¡¯d love to talk about traveling together and maybe settling down in a place we both love.  
That sounds fantastic! I¡¯ve always dreamed of having a cozy home with you. What do you think our biggest challenge is?  
I think it¡¯s making time for each other amid our busy lives. We need to prioritize us.  
I agree. Let's promise to be more intentional about our relationship moving forward.  
Yes, let¡¯s really commit to that. It¡¯s important that we don¡¯t lose the spark.  
How do you feel about the balance between our individual lives and our life as a couple?  
I think it¡¯s crucial to support each other's passions while also nurturing our connection. What can we do better?  
We can create more shared experiences while still cheering for each other's dreams. How does that sound?
