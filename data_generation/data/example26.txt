"Hey, how have you been feeling about school lately?"  
"I¡¯ve been struggling a bit with the workload, to be honest."  
"I totally understand. It can be overwhelming sometimes. Have you talked to anyone about it?"  
"Not really. I feel like I should just manage it on my own."  
"That¡¯s a common feeling, but it¡¯s okay to ask for help too. Have you thought about meeting with a teacher?"  
"Maybe, but I don¡¯t want to seem like I can¡¯t handle things."  
"It¡¯s brave to ask for help. Teachers appreciate when students seek guidance."  
"I guess that makes sense. I just don¡¯t want to feel like a burden."  
"You¡¯re not a burden! Everyone struggles at times. It helps to share the load."  
"True, but sometimes I feel so alone in this."  
"You¡¯re not alone! I¡¯m here for you. We can talk it out whenever you need."  
"Thanks, that means a lot. It¡¯s just tough to stay motivated."  
"Have you considered breaking tasks into smaller chunks? That might make it easier."  
"That could work. I¡¯ll give it a try. What about you? How is school treating you?"  
"It¡¯s been okay, but I¡¯ve been feeling stress too, especially before exams."  
"I get that. It can be hard to balance it all. Want to study together sometime?"  
"Definitely! Studying together could help us both feel less anxious."  
"Great! We can support each other through it. What subjects are you finding the hardest?"  
"The math classes have been particularly challenging for me."  
"I remember you mentioning that at the start. Have you thought about applying some of those new strategies to your math?"  
"Yeah, I can try breaking the problems down, just like we talked about. Do you think it¡¯ll help me feel less overwhelmed?"  
"Absolutely! Just like we discussed at the beginning, asking for help and breaking things down can really relieve that burden."
