How has school been treating you lately?  
It's been tough, honestly. I feel really overwhelmed with everything.  
I can understand that. What's been the most challenging part for you?  
I think it's the pressure of exams and keeping up with all the coursework.  
That sounds really stressful. Have you been able to find any time to relax?  
Not really. I feel guilty whenever I take a break, like I should be studying.  
It's important to take breaks, though. They can actually help you perform better.  
I know, but it just feels so hard to allow myself that time.  
Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?  
Not much. I don't want to burden my friends or family with my issues.  
You know, sharing your feelings can really lighten the load. They might understand more than you think.  
That¡¯s true. I guess I¡¯m just worried they might not take it seriously.  
It¡¯s normal to feel that way, but those who care about you usually will take it seriously.  
Maybe I should try talking to someone after all.  
Definitely. Have you considered reaching out to a teacher or counselor?  
I haven¡¯t thought about that, but it might help to hear their perspective on things.  
Absolutely. They¡¯re there to support you. What subject do you find most difficult right now?  
Math has been really hard for me this semester. I feel lost in class sometimes.  
Math can be tricky. Would getting a tutor or attending extra help sessions be an option for you?  
That could help. I just hate feeling like I need extra help.  
Everyone needs help at some point; it doesn¡¯t mean you¡¯re not capable.  
You¡¯re right. I can try to change my mindset about that.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that! What are your goals for this semester?  
I just want to pass all my classes and regain some confidence in my abilities.  
That¡¯s a great goal. It¡¯s all about progress, not perfection. How are you planning to achieve it?  
I think I¡¯ll start by creating a study schedule and sticking to it.  
That sounds like a solid plan! How do you feel about discussing the study schedule with a friend?  
I think discussing it might keep me accountable and less alone in this.  
Exactly! It¡¯s wonderful to have support. Have you chosen anyone specific to share your plans with?  
I might ask Jamie; she seems to be managing her workload well.  
She¡¯s a great choice! Do you think opening up about your struggles could help you both?  
Yes, I feel like it could strengthen our friendship and tackle school pressures together.  
I'm really proud of you for considering that. Do you think you'll reach out to Jamie soon?  
I hope to. It all comes back to needing a support system, doesn¡¯t it?  
Yes, just like we talked about in the beginning. It¡¯s important to have that emotional care during school.
