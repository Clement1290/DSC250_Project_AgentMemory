How have you been feeling about us lately?  
I've been feeling a bit distant, to be honest.  
What do you think is causing that distance?  
I think it's a mix of stress from work and not spending enough quality time together.  
Do you feel we¡¯ve lost our connection?  
Sometimes, yes. I miss the way we used to talk and share our thoughts.  
What could we do to reconnect?  
Maybe we can set aside some time each week just for us, no distractions.  
That sounds like a great idea. What activities would you enjoy?  
I'd love to go on walks together or have regular movie nights.  
Those sound perfect! Do you think we¡¯ve been neglecting our needs?  
Definitely. We get so caught up in everything else that we forget to nurture our relationship.  
How can we prioritize our relationship better?  
By scheduling time for each other and sticking to it, no matter what.  
What about small gestures during the week?  
Yes, those can make a big difference! A simple text or a sweet note can brighten my day.  
I can start writing more notes for you! How would that make you feel?  
That would mean a lot! It shows you're thinking about me, even in the little moments.  
How are you feeling about sharing your thoughts with me more openly?  
I think it's vital for us; it helps me feel supported and close to you.  
Do you feel safe expressing your needs?  
I do, but I sometimes worry about burdening you with my feelings.  
You could never be a burden; I want to support you! What can I do to reassure you?  
Maybe just remind me that it¡¯s okay to express myself and that you¡¯re here for me.  
I promise to do that. How about we check in with each other regularly?  
That sounds wonderful! What will be our first step to making these changes?  
Let¡¯s commit to our first movie night next weekend and plan our week from there.  
Do you remember how we used to enjoy those nights in the early days of our relationship?  
Yes! We would pick a film we both loved and just cuddle on the couch like nothing else mattered.
