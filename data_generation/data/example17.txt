How have you been feeling about family gatherings lately?  
I've been feeling a bit anxious since our last family reunion; it was overwhelming for me.  
I understand. Sometimes, those big gatherings can feel a bit too much.  
Yeah, and I worry I'm not connecting with everyone like I should.  
It's okay to feel that way; not every moment has to be perfect.  
True, but I just want to be there for everyone, you know?  
That's really kind of you. It shows how much you care.  
Thanks, but I still feel guilty when I can't keep up.  
It's important to take care of yourself too. You don't have to do it all.  
I guess I just fear missing out on important moments.  
You won't miss out if you find the right balance for yourself.  
Have you considered talking to someone about how you feel?  
That might help; I just don't want to burden anyone.  
It's not a burden when you share your feelings; it opens the door for support.  
You¡¯re right; I just need to find the right person to talk to.  
Maybe start with a close family member you trust.  
That sounds like a good idea. I feel safer sharing with them.  
Exactly! They might be feeling something similar too.  
I hope so. It would be nice to connect over this together.  
It's all about finding that emotional connection we share as a family.  
Do you think we can make more time for those meaningful one-on-one talks at our next gathering?  
Absolutely! It would be a great way to strengthen our family bonds and address how we all feel.
