"Hey, I noticed you've seemed a bit stressed lately with schoolwork. Is everything okay?"  
"I appreciate you asking. It's just that I have so many assignments piling up, and I feel overwhelmed."  
"That sounds really tough. Have you thought about breaking them down into smaller tasks?"  
"Yeah, I started to do that, but sometimes just looking at the amount feels discouraging."  
"It can definitely be discouraging. Maybe we could set some time together to tackle them?"  
"That would be great! I think some company would help me stay focused."  
"I'm glad to hear that. We can make it a study session and take breaks in between, too."  
"That sounds like a perfect plan! I always find it hard to stay motivated on my own."  
"Totally understand. Having someone to share the workload makes it feel less daunting."  
"Exactly, and I think I need that extra support right now."  
"I'm here for you. You¡¯ve helped me out in the past when I was struggling."  
"I remember that. It¡¯s nice to know we can lean on each other."  
"Definitely! Plus, we can cheer each other on as we tick off those assignments."  
"Yes, celebrating small wins can really lift my spirits."  
"I'm all about those small celebrations! It¡¯s a good way to stay positive."  
"True! I feel better already just talking about it. Sometimes I just need to share."  
"Communication is key, especially when dealing with stress. You¡¯re doing great."  
"Thanks! I¡¯m trying to remind myself that it¡¯s okay to ask for help."  
"Absolutely, asking for help shows strength, not weakness."  
"Could we maybe check in with each other more often about our schoolwork?"  
"That sounds like a fantastic idea! It would really help maintain our motivation together."  
"I'm glad you¡¯re on board with that! Do you think we can set a specific time each week?"
