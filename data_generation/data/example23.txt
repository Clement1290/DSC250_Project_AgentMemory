"Hey, how was your day at school today? I know you had that big math test."  
"It was really tough, but I think I managed somehow. I just felt so anxious before it."  
"I understand. Tests can be really stressful. Did you have a chance to review anything before?"  
"Yeah, I studied a bit with Emma, but I still felt like I forgot everything. It was overwhelming."  
"It's okay to feel that way. Remember, you did your best, and that's what matters most."  
"Thanks, I needed to hear that. Sometimes I feel like I just can't keep up with everything."  
"It¡¯s completely normal to feel that way. School can be a lot to handle at times. Have you talked to anyone about it?"  
"I mentioned it to my teacher, and she suggested I take breaks while studying. It helped a little."  
"That¡¯s a good approach! Breaks can really help clear your mind. Have you been able to take those breaks?"  
"I've tried, but sometimes I get so caught up in my work that I forget."  
"That happens! Maybe you can set a timer for a break? It could help remind you."  
"That's a smart idea! I'll give it a shot. I'm just worried about the next round of tests."  
"One step at a time. Focus on one subject at a time, and try not to compare yourself to others."  
"I do find myself comparing... but it's hard not to!"  
"True, but everyone has their own pace. Celebrate your own progress, no matter how small."  
"I'll try to remember that. It¡¯s just tough when I see others doing so well."  
"You can support each other! Study groups can be great for motivation and sharing different strengths."  
"I hadn't thought of that. I might ask a few classmates to join me."  
"That sounds great! Just make sure it feels like a team effort and not a race."  
"Exactly! Thanks for being here to talk about this. It really helps."  
"I'm always here for you. So, after all this worry about tests and studying, what do you think would help you feel more prepared for the next one?"
