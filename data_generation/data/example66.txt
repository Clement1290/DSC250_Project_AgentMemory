I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed with my workload lately.  
I¡¯m really sorry to hear that. What¡¯s been weighing on you the most?  
It¡¯s just so many deadlines piling up at once, and I¡¯m not sure I can handle it all.  
Have you considered talking to your manager about it? They might be able to help.  
I thought about it, but I don¡¯t want to seem incapable or like I can¡¯t manage my tasks.  
It¡¯s completely understandable to ask for help. Everyone needs support sometimes.  
That¡¯s true. I just worry about how it might come across to my colleagues.  
Your well-being is more important than how others might perceive you.  
I appreciate that. I need to remind myself that it¡¯s okay to prioritize my mental health.  
Absolutely! Sometimes taking a step back can lead to better productivity in the long run.  
Exactly! I¡¯ve thought about setting boundaries but it feels difficult to implement.  
Start small, maybe just limit your hours during the day and communicate that to your team.  
That sounds doable. I could try that and see how it goes.  
And don¡¯t hesitate to reach out to someone you trust for support when you feel stressed.  
I haven't really talked about this with anyone yet, but I think I might need to soon.  
That¡¯s a great idea. Sharing your feelings can lighten the load significantly.  
Yeah, I guess I¡¯ve been hesitant because I don¡¯t want to burden anyone else.  
You¡¯re not a burden. Friends and colleagues often want to help, even if you don¡¯t think so.  
Thanks for saying that; it helps me feel less isolated in my struggles.  
How do you generally cope when work gets too overwhelming for you?  
Well, I usually take a moment to breathe and remind myself that it's okay to ask for help.
