I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. What¡¯s been weighing you down the most?  
I have so many deadlines approaching, and I feel like I¡¯m drowning in tasks.  
It sounds really stressful. Have you talked to anyone about how you¡¯re feeling?  
Not really, I don¡¯t want to burden my colleagues.  
It¡¯s important to share how you¡¯re feeling; it could lighten your load a bit.  
I guess you¡¯re right. But I don¡¯t want them to think I can¡¯t handle my work.  
Everyone has moments when they struggle. It shows strength to ask for help.  
I appreciate that perspective. I just want to keep up with my responsibilities.  
Of course, but remember to take care of yourself too. Your well-being matters.  
It¡¯s hard to balance everything. I often feel guilty when I take breaks.  
Guilt can be tough, but breaks are essential for staying productive.  
I know, but I always worry about falling behind.  
What if you set small goals during your day? That way, you can feel accomplished.  
That might help. I just need to change my mindset a bit.  
Definitely! Celebrate those small wins, no matter how minor they seem.  
Thanks for the encouragement. I really need to remind myself of that.  
I¡¯m always here to support you. Have you thought about how you¡¯ll manage those deadlines?  
I think I¡¯ll create a to-do list tomorrow and prioritize my tasks.  
That¡¯s a great start! You might find it easier to approach your workload that way.  
Yes, I think I will. Thank you for listening and caring about my situation.  
How are you feeling about prioritizing your tasks now, knowing it¡¯ll help with your overwhelming workload?
