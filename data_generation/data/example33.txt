I¡¯ve been feeling so overwhelmed with the workload lately.  
I understand, it can be really stressful when things pile up. What¡¯s been bothering you the most?  
It¡¯s mostly the deadlines and trying to balance my team¡¯s needs.  
That sounds tough. Have you been able to talk to your team about it?  
Not really, I don¡¯t want to be seen as incapable.  
I get that, but sharing your feelings might actually help them understand your situation.  
You¡¯re right. I guess I fear they¡¯ll see it as a weakness.  
It¡¯s not a weakness to feel overwhelmed; it shows that you care about your work.  
Thanks, that¡¯s reassuring. I just don¡¯t want to let anyone down.  
You won¡¯t let anyone down by being honest about your limits.  
Sometimes, I feel like I have to keep pushing through, even when I¡¯ve hit my limit.  
Pushing through can be exhausting; taking a break might actually boost your productivity.  
I do need to take a step back, but it¡¯s hard to find the time.  
Maybe you can prioritize tasks or delegate some responsibilities?  
Delegating is difficult for me; I don¡¯t want to burden anyone else.  
It¡¯s not a burden if everyone is part of the solution. Plus, it builds teamwork.  
That makes sense. I guess I need to trust my colleagues more.  
Absolutely! They¡¯ll appreciate you reaching out for help.  
Thank you for listening; I always feel better after we talk.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that! Remember, it¡¯s okay to seek support at work.  
Do you think talking to my team about how I feel might lead to better collaboration?  
Definitely! Opening up could strengthen your team bond and create a more supportive environment.
