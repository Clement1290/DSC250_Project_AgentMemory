I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately.  
I understand, it can be so challenging when things pile up like that. What¡¯s been weighing on you the most?  
It¡¯s mostly the deadlines; it feels like I¡¯m constantly racing against the clock.  
That sounds stressful. Have you been able to talk to anyone about it, or find some ways to manage that pressure?  
I¡¯ve mentioned it to a few colleagues, but I¡¯m hesitant to burden them with my issues.  
You¡¯re not a burden at all! Sometimes sharing can lighten the load. How do you usually cope when you feel this way?  
I try to focus on one task at a time, but then I start stressing about everything I haven¡¯t done.  
That¡¯s completely understandable. Prioritizing can really help. Have you tried creating a list?  
I have, but I end up adding more things than I cross off, which just adds to my anxiety.  
It¡¯s tough when lists feel like they grow instead of shrink. Maybe a simpler approach could help?  
Like what? I¡¯m not sure I can manage anything simpler than my current list.  
What if you just focused on three main tasks each day? It could reduce the pressure to finish everything at once.  
That might help! I think I can handle three tasks; it feels more manageable.  
Exactly! And remember to celebrate those small victories, even if it¡¯s just completing one task.  
I usually forget to do that. I get caught up in what¡¯s still left to do.  
It¡¯s easy to overlook your accomplishments. Maybe you could set a little reward for yourself for each completed task?  
That sounds nice! It would give me something to look forward to.  
I¡¯m glad you like that idea! It¡¯s important to recognize your efforts. How have you been sleeping through all this?  
Not great, honestly. I lay awake thinking about the work I haven't finished.  
That sounds really challenging. Have you considered setting a cutoff time for work each evening?  
I haven¡¯t, but that¡¯s a great suggestion. I need to start prioritizing my rest too.  
Definitely! Your mental health is so important, especially in a demanding work environment.  
Thanks for reminding me! I tend to forget about self-care when I¡¯m stressed.  
It¡¯s easy to lose sight of that, but taking care of yourself can really improve your productivity.  
You¡¯re right. I¡¯ll try to be kinder to myself moving forward. What are some quick self-care activities I could do during breaks?  
How about a short walk outside or some breathing exercises? It can really help clear your mind.   
That sounds perfect! I¡¯ll start incorporating those into my day. So, to bring it back, have you thought about how focusing on those three tasks can ease your feelings of being overwhelmed?
