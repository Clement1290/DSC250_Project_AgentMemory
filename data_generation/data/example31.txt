"Hey, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with school lately."  
"I'm sorry to hear that. What's been bothering you the most?"  
"Honestly, I have too many assignments piling up and it's stressing me out."  
"That sounds tough. Do you want to talk about what you have due?"  
"I have a paper for history and a project for science, both due this week."  
"Have you started on them, or are you feeling stuck?"  
"I've started, but I just can¡¯t seem to focus on either."  
"Maybe try breaking them down into smaller tasks. That might help you feel less overwhelmed."  
"That¡¯s a good idea. I guess I just need to organize my time better."  
"Would it help if we made a schedule together? I can help keep you accountable."  
"I would really appreciate that! It¡¯s always easier with someone else."  
"Great! How about we set aside some time tomorrow to outline everything?"  
"Perfect! I¡¯ll bring my assignments so we can go through them one by one."  
"Sounds like a plan. And remember to take breaks to recharge; it's important."  
"Right! I tend to forget that when I¡¯m busy."  
"Just keep reminding yourself that it¡¯s okay to take a step back sometimes."  
"Thanks for being so understanding. It really helps to talk about it."  
"I¡¯m always here for you. We¡¯re in this together!"  
"I feel better just knowing that. It means a lot."  
"Of course! So, did you want to talk more about those assignments today?"  
"Yes! I would love to go over that history paper we mentioned earlier."
