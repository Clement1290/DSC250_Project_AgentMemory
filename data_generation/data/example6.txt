"Hey, I've noticed you seem a bit stressed about school lately."  
"Yeah, it's just been really overwhelming with all the projects and exams coming up."  
"That's understandable. Have you thought about ways to manage your time better?"  
"I've tried, but sometimes I just feel stuck and don't know where to start."  
"Maybe we could sit down together and plan out your schedule? It might help to have some support."  
"I would appreciate that a lot. It's hard to ask for help sometimes."  
"There's no shame in asking for help! It shows strength to reach out."  
"Thanks for saying that. I just hate feeling like I'm falling behind."  
"You're not falling behind. You're just feeling a lot of pressure right now."  
"That's true. I just want to do well and make my family proud."  
"I get that. Just remember that your worth isn¡¯t just tied to grades."  
"That means a lot. I guess sometimes I forget there's more to life than academics."  
"Exactly! And taking care of yourself comes first. It¡¯s okay to take breaks."  
"I really struggle with that. I feel guilty when I'm not studying."  
"You deserve those breaks. Balance is important, especially in school."  
"I know, I wish I could find that balance more easily."  
"Maybe we can find some relaxing activities you enjoy together?"  
"I'd love that! Sometimes I just need a distraction."  
"How about we plan a fun study session or even go for a walk?"  
"That sounds perfect. I feel a bit lighter just thinking about it."  
"I'm glad to hear that! So, after our walk, we can tackle your school projects together, right?"  
"Yes! And I can share those initial worries I had about school with you again."
