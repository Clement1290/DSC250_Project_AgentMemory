How have you been feeling about the workload lately?  
I've been a bit overwhelmed, honestly. It feels like there's just too much on my plate.  
I completely understand. It's tough to manage everything at once. What part is overwhelming you the most?  
I think it's the deadlines. They keep piling up and it's hard to stay motivated.  
Have you thought about sharing some of the tasks with your team? Sometimes delegation can really help.  
I haven¡¯t really considered that. I guess I¡¯m worried about burdening others.  
You're not a burden; your team wants to support you. Have you talked to anyone about how you feel?  
Not really. I tend to shut down when I¡¯m stressed, but maybe I should reach out.  
That sounds like a good idea. It's always healthier to communicate these feelings.  
You're right. I just don't want to seem like I'm not handling things well.  
Everyone struggles at times; it shows strength to ask for help. Life is a team effort, after all.  
That's true. I think I have this fear of letting people down if I admit I'm struggling.  
It¡¯s okay to be vulnerable. It can actually bring you closer to your colleagues.  
I¡¯ll try to remember that. Maybe I could plan a team meeting to discuss our workload.  
That's a fantastic approach! It opens up the possibility for everyone to share.  
I think that might ease my anxiety a bit. It's just hard to take that first step.  
It is tough, but you have the support of your team, and they'll appreciate your honesty.  
I guess I just need to believe that it's okay to ask for support.  
Absolutely, you deserve to take care of your mental health. How about setting that meeting for next week?  
That sounds good! I think I¡¯ll feel better once I have that conversation.  
What¡¯s the main message you want to convey to your team during that meeting about workload?
