How have you been feeling about family gatherings lately?  
I've been a bit anxious about them, to be honest. They can bring up so many emotions.  
I understand that. It can be tough seeing everyone and dealing with past issues.  
Exactly. I love my family, but sometimes old wounds resurface.  
Have you thought about talking to someone about those past issues?  
I have, but it feels vulnerable to open up about it.  
It's okay to feel vulnerable; it shows how much those feelings matter to you.  
True, and I do want to heal those parts of me.  
Maybe it would help to express how you feel directly to your family?  
That's a scary thought. What if they don¡¯t understand?  
They might surprise you. Sometimes families can be more supportive than we expect.  
I hope that's the case. Communication feels both frightening and freeing.  
Absolutely. It can bridge gaps and create new connections.  
I wish I could share my feelings without fear of judgment.  
What if you started with just one family member you trust?  
That¡¯s a good idea. It might feel safer to start small.  
After that, how do you think you¡¯d feel about the gatherings?  
I think it would make attending feel lighter, knowing I¡¯ve shared.  
That sounds like a promising start. You deserve to feel at ease with your family.  
Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to have your support.  
Of course! We all need someone to lean on when navigating family dynamics.  
Looking back, do you think sharing your feelings would have changed how you felt at those past family gatherings?
