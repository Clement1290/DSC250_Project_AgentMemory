I just wanted to talk about how overwhelmed I've been feeling at work lately.  
I'm really sorry to hear that. What's been weighing on your mind?  
I've got so many deadlines coming up, and I feel like I'm drowning.  
That sounds incredibly stressful. Have you had a chance to take breaks?  
Not really, I feel guilty when I step away.  
I understand, but taking breaks can actually help you be more productive.  
I know, but it's hard to shift that mindset sometimes.  
It really is. Maybe you could start with just a short walk?  
That sounds nice, but what if things pile up while I'm gone?  
It's okay to let things wait a bit; your well-being is important, too.  
You¡¯re right. I guess I should try to prioritize my health over the workload.  
Absolutely! Remember, you're not alone in this. I¡¯m here for you.  
Thanks, that really means a lot. Does everyone feel this way at work?  
Many people do, especially during busy periods. It's a common struggle.  
That makes me feel a little better knowing I'm not the only one.  
Of course! We all experience these moments. Do you have a support system?  
I do, but sometimes I hesitate to reach out for help.  
It's okay to lean on others when you're feeling this way; it shows strength.  
You¡¯re right. I guess I just don¡¯t want to burden anyone.  
But sharing can lighten your load and strengthen your connections.  
That¡¯s true. How do you manage stress when it gets overwhelming?  
I try to talk it out, just like we are now, and find healthy distractions.  
That¡¯s good advice. Speaking of which, do you think I could really benefit from talking to my team about this?  
Definitely! Opening up could foster understanding and support among your team members.
