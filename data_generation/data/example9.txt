I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed with all the deadlines at work.  
I can understand that; deadlines can be really stressful. What¡¯s been the hardest part for you?  
I think it¡¯s the pressure to meet everyone¡¯s expectations while balancing my own workload.  
That can be really tough. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?  
Not really. I don¡¯t want to burden anyone with my problems.  
It's not a burden; friends and colleagues care about you. They might offer support or even share their own struggles.  
You're right. I just wish I could handle it all without feeling so anxious.  
It¡¯s completely normal to feel anxious under pressure. Have you tried any coping mechanisms?  
I¡¯ve tried meditation, but it¡¯s hard to stick with it when I¡¯m busy.  
Maybe you could start with just a few minutes a day? Even a brief pause can help clear your mind.  
That sounds manageable. I¡¯ll give it a try. I just don¡¯t want to let anyone down.  
Remember, taking care of your mental health is essential. You can only perform your best when you feel good.  
True. Maybe I should prioritize my well-being more instead of putting everything else first.  
Absolutely! Your well-being will reflect positively on your work too.  
Thanks for understanding. It helps to share my feelings with someone.  
Of course! I¡¯m here for you, and it's important to have a support system.  
I¡¯d appreciate checking in with you more often, just to talk about how things are going.  
I¡¯d love that! It¡¯s great to have someone to share both challenges and successes with.  
Speaking of successes, do you have any accomplishments recently that you¡¯re proud of?  
Actually, I just completed a project ahead of schedule, and I felt really good about it.  
That¡¯s fantastic! Celebrating those wins can help boost your confidence during tough times.  
Thanks, I needed that reminder. How do you manage to stay motivated at work?  
I focus on my passions and try to find joy even in small tasks. It keeps my spirits high.  
That¡¯s inspiring! I¡¯ll work on focusing on the positives instead of just the overwhelming parts.  
Do you think that focusing on your recent success could help you feel more balanced as you tackle the deadlines?
