I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed with my workload lately.  
I can understand that. It¡¯s tough when things pile up, especially when you care so much about doing a good job.  

Sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for this.  
You¡¯re definitely cut out for it! Everyone goes through rough patches, and it doesn¡¯t reflect your abilities.  

Thanks for saying that. It¡¯s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now.  
I truly believe in your strength. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to lighten that load together?  

That would be really helpful. I feel like there¡¯s just so much on my plate.  
Let¡¯s break it down. What¡¯s the biggest thing stressing you out at the moment?  

I¡¯ve got this big project due soon, and it feels like I¡¯m behind already.  
That¡¯s a lot of pressure. Have you talked to anyone about extending the deadline or getting help?  

Not yet, I feel bad asking for extensions.  
It¡¯s okay to ask for help. It shows that you care about the quality of your work.  

You¡¯re right. I just hate letting people down.  
You won¡¯t let anyone down by needing support. It shows you¡¯re committed to your success.  

I guess I need to work on my mindset.  
Absolutely! Remember, it¡¯s okay to prioritize your well-being. What else is on your mind?  

I think my fear of disappointing others holds me back.  
That¡¯s understandable. But remember, you can¡¯t pour from an empty cup. Your health comes first.  

True, I just have to remind myself of that more often.  
How about setting small, achievable goals each day? That might help mitigate some of the anxiety.  

That sounds like a good strategy. I¡¯ll give it a try.  
I¡¯ll be here to support you through it! Want to share your first goal?  

I plan to focus on completing the project outline today.  
That sounds great! That¡¯s a solid first step to getting the project moving forward.  

I feel a bit better already. Having a plan helps.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that! We can check in later to see how it went.  

Thanks, it means a lot to know you care.  
Always here to lend a listening ear. How can I support you during this project?  

Maybe just checking in with me regularly would help.  
Absolutely! Let¡¯s set up a time to touch base each week.  

That would be perfect. I appreciate you doing that!  
Of course! It's important to me that you feel supported. Do you feel ready to tackle that outline?  

Yes, I do! I think taking it one step at a time will help me manage my stress.  
That's definitely the way to go. I believe you¡¯ll create something amazing. How does breaking things down into smaller tasks align with your feelings about the project from the start?
