I¡¯ve been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately.  
I¡¯m sorry to hear that. What¡¯s been causing you to feel this way?  
I have a lot of projects due, and I¡¯m worried I won¡¯t meet the deadlines.  
That sounds really stressful. Have you talked to anyone about how you¡¯re feeling?  
Not really, I don¡¯t want to burden my coworkers.  
I understand, but sometimes sharing can lighten the load a bit.  
True, but I don't want to appear weak or incapable.  
It¡¯s not weak to ask for help; it shows you¡¯re human and managing a lot.  
You¡¯re right. I guess I just fear judgment.  
We all face challenges, and asking for support can be a sign of strength.  
That¡¯s a good perspective. I¡¯ll consider talking to my manager.  
I think that¡¯s a great idea! They might help you prioritize your tasks.  
I hope so. It¡¯d be nice to have some guidance right now.  
Absolutely, and remember to take breaks to recharge when you can.  
I¡¯ve been skipping breaks because I feel like I don¡¯t have time.  
That¡¯s understandable, but those breaks can help increase your productivity.  
I know, I just struggle to find that balance between work and self-care.  
It¡¯s a tough balance, but it¡¯s important to find it to avoid burnout.  
I appreciate your concern; it makes me feel less alone in this.  
I¡¯m always here for you. How are you planning to approach your conversation with your manager?  
I think I¡¯ll start by discussing my workload and how I'm feeling overwhelmed.  
That sounds like a good starting point. It reflects the honesty you¡¯ve shared with me today.
