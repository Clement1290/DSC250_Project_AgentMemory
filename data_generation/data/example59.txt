How have you been feeling about our relationship lately?  
I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, honestly. I think we need to talk more.  
I appreciate you sharing that. What specifically makes you feel overwhelmed?  
Sometimes I feel like we're not on the same page and it worries me.  
I understand. Let's take some time to really listen to each other about what we need.  
That sounds good. I think we should set aside time for just us, without distractions.  
I would love that! It will help us reconnect and clear the air.  
Do you remember the last time we had a deep conversation?  
Yes, it was at that little caf¨¦ we used to go to. I felt really close to you then.  
That was a special moment. I¡¯d like to recreate that atmosphere.  
Me too! Do you think we can be more open about our feelings moving forward?  
Definitely! Transparency will only strengthen our bond, I believe.  
What do you find most challenging when it comes to being open with me?  
I worry about how you might react and if it will hurt you.  
I appreciate your concern. I wish you would trust that I can handle it.  
I know, and I value that about you. It just takes time for me to see it clearly.  
It's okay to take your time. We can work through this together, step by step.  
Thank you for your patience. I feel lucky to have your support in this.  
How can we create a safe space for each other to voice our concerns?  
Maybe we can make a pact to share one concern each week, like we did at the caf¨¦?  
I love that idea! It brings back those moments I cherish, where we could just be open.  
Do you think recreating those special moments will help us feel more connected again?
