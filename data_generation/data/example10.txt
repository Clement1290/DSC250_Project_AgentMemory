How have you been feeling about your painting lately?  
I've been feeling a bit discouraged, to be honest. I don't think I'm improving.  
It's normal to hit a rough patch. What specifically has been bothering you?  
I guess I just compare myself to others and their amazing work.  
I understand that; social media can be overwhelming. Have you tried focusing on your own progress?  
Yes, I started keeping a journal of my sketches, but it¡¯s hard to stay positive.  
It¡¯s great that you're focusing on your sketches! How do you feel when you look back at them?  
Sometimes I see improvement, but other times I just feel stuck.  
Have you thought about taking a short break to clear your mind?  
That's a good idea. A little distance might offer a fresh perspective.  
Definitely! Maybe you could try a new medium or technique during the break?  
That could be fun! I've always wanted to try watercolors.  
Watercolors are beautiful! They have a different feel. What draws you to them?  
I love how they blend and create soft, dreamy effects.  
That sounds really inspiring! Do you think you would feel less pressure if you just experimented?  
Yes, I think so. Just enjoying the process would help me relax more.  
Exactly! Remember, it¡¯s about expressing yourself, not just the end result.  
You¡¯re right; I need to remind myself of that. How do you maintain your joy in your hobbies?  
I try to set aside specific times just to enjoy them without judgment.  
That's a helpful approach! Do you have any particular hobbies you enjoy like that?  
I love gardening. Connecting with nature really centers me.  
That sounds lovely! Do you find joy in seeing your plants grow?  
Absolutely! Watching something flourish is so rewarding, just like your art journey!  
Thank you for that! Speaking of growth, what do you hope to achieve with your painting in the future?  
I want to be able to create pieces that express my emotions beautifully, like how I feel when gardening.
