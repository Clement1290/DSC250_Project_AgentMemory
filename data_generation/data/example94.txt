How have you been feeling about work lately?  
It's been a bit stressful, honestly. I feel overwhelmed with deadlines.  
I can imagine; those can be really tough to handle. Is there anything specific that's weighing on your mind?  
Yes, I have this big project due soon, and I¡¯m worried I won¡¯t meet expectations.  
It's natural to feel that way, especially if you care about doing well. Have you thought about breaking it down into smaller tasks?  
That might help, but I still fear I won¡¯t have enough time to finish everything.  
Time management can be challenging. Have you talked to your manager about your concerns?  
Not yet, but I think I should. I just don¡¯t want them to think I can¡¯t handle my responsibilities.  
It's okay to ask for help or guidance. It shows you¡¯re proactive and care about your work.  
That¡¯s true. I just need the confidence to approach them.  
Maybe you could frame it as wanting to ensure the best outcome for the team.  
That¡¯s a good idea! I want to be a valuable team member.  
Absolutely, and remember, it¡¯s okay to admit when things feel like too much.  
Thank you for reminding me of that. I often feel like I should be able to handle everything alone.  
You¡¯re not alone. Everyone goes through tough patches at work; it's part of the journey.  
I appreciate your support; it really helps to talk about this.  
I¡¯m glad to hear that! What do you think would make you feel more settled at work?  
Probably having clear communication with my team and knowing I can reach out when I'm struggling.  
That sounds like a solid plan. What steps can you take to initiate that conversation?  
I could start by sharing my workload and asking for feedback, maybe even during our next team meeting.  
That sounds perfect! It allows for openness and shows your commitment to the team.  
Thanks for your encouragement! How do you think this conversation will evolve in terms of your project?  
I think by sharing my worries about meeting deadlines, it will open doors to support, just like we discussed at the beginning.
