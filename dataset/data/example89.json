            "Student": "Hi, I'm Aisha Khan. It's my first time here.",
            "Counselor": "Hello Aisha! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I'm feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. It's the first day of classes, and I’m worried about meeting new people.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely understandable. Starting a new semester can be both thrilling and stressful. What specifically are you feeling worried about?",
            "Student": "I worry about fitting in. I saw a group of students laughing together, and it made me feel self-conscious.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to feel that way. Many students experience similar feelings. Can you tell me more about what you hope for this semester?",
            "Student": "I want to make friends and connect with people who share my interests, especially in psychology.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a wonderful goal! Connecting with like-minded individuals can really enhance your college experience. Have you thought about any activities or clubs you might want to join?",
            "Student": "Yes! I’m thinking of joining the psychology club, but I’m not sure about it.",
            "Counselor": "Joining clubs is a great way to meet people. It might ease your worries about finding your place. How do you feel about taking that step?"

            "Student": "Hey, it’s me again. I joined the psychology club, but I feel really overshadowed.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Aisha! It’s good to see you. I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling overshadowed. Can you share more about what's happening?",
            "Student": "There’s this girl, Jenna, who always dominates our conversations. I feel like I can’t get a word in.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds frustrating. It’s tough to feel unheard, especially in a space you joined to connect with others. Have you considered expressing your thoughts to the group?",
            "Student": "I thought about it, but I worry they won’t listen or that they won't value my input.",
            "Counselor": "Your voice is valuable, Aisha. It might also help to practice what you want to say beforehand so you feel more confident.",
            "Student": "That’s a good idea. I’ll try to prepare some points to bring up.",
            "Counselor": "Excellent! Remember, it’s a learning experience. Feeling isolated is common, but you're not alone in this. Keep pushing through."

            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Aisha. I’m glad you reached out. Can you tell me what's making you feel overwhelmed?",
            "Student": "It's the workload, and I still can't voice my ideas. I feel like I'm letting my group down.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re overwhelmed. Let’s break things down together. What parts of the project do you feel most comfortable with?",
            "Student": "I like the research part, but I’m afraid of my ideas not being good enough.",
            "Counselor": "Every idea can contribute a unique perspective. Maybe you can start by sharing one small idea with your group.",
            "Student": "I guess that could help, but I worry I’ll freeze up if I try.",
            "Counselor": "That happens to many people! It’s okay. You can even write your thoughts down or discuss them with Sam first to gain confidence."

            "Counselor": "That’s fantastic! Sharing your voice is such a big step. How did it feel to contribute?",
            "Student": "I felt nervous at first, but once I started speaking, it was so rewarding. I think I’ll keep doing this.",
            "Counselor": "I’m really proud of you! This experience can lead to even more growth. How do you feel moving forward?",
            "Student": "I feel more determined and confident in myself. It’s amazing what can happen when you push through fear.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! Remember this feeling and keep nurturing it. If you ever need more support, I’m here for you.",
