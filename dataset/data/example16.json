            "Counselor": "Hello, Liam! It’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit embarrassed. I had my first seminar yesterday, and I messed up during a presentation.",
            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. Presentations can be really daunting. What happened during your presentation?",
            "Student": "Well, my classmate, Ryan, kept dominating the conversation, and I forgot some of my key points. It felt really discouraging.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds frustrating. It’s hard when you feel overshadowed in a group setting. How did that impact your confidence?"

            "Counselor": "I’m glad you came back, Liam. What’s been happening since our last conversation?",
            "Student": "After the seminar, I've started avoiding discussions. I had lunch with my friend Julia, and I told her about feeling out of place.",
            "Counselor": "It’s good that you shared your feelings with Julia. How did she respond?",
            "Student": "She was supportive, but I still feel like I don’t belong here, especially after yesterday.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings can be tough to navigate. Have you thought about small steps you could take to begin participating more actively in discussions?"

            "Counselor": "Thank you for sharing that, Liam. What’s causing you to feel so overwhelmed?",
            "Student": "I keep replaying the seminar in my head. I’m worried about my grades and feel like maybe I should drop my seminar class.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re under pressure. Have you had the chance to talk to anyone about your feelings?",
            "Student": "I talked to my family, but the doubts are still there. I feel like I’m falling behind.",
            "Counselor": "It’s common to feel that way when things get tough. What about setting small goals for your study sessions or reaching out to your professor for guidance?"

            "Student": "I want to explain my anxiety and see if there are ways to improve my participation in class.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a great plan. How do you feel about initiating this conversation with your professor?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling nervous, but there’s also some hope that I can regain my confidence and improve.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! Seeking help shows strength, and your feelings are entirely valid. I’m here to support you.",
