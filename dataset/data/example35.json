            "Student": "Hi, I’m Ethan Carter. It’s nice to meet you.",
            "Counselor": "Hello Ethan! It's great to meet you too. How are you feeling today as the semester begins?",
            "Student": "I’m really excited about my Mechanical Engineering courses, but I’m also feeling a bit anxious.",
            "Counselor": "That combination of excitement and anxiety is quite common. What’s causing your anxiety?",
            "Student": "I recently joined a sustainability project team, and I’m worried about keeping up with deadlines while maintaining good grades.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Managing academics and a team project can be challenging. Do you have a plan in place?",
            "Student": "Not really, I’m still figuring things out. I want to make a positive impact, but the pressure is daunting.",
            "Counselor": "It’s wonderful that you want to create a positive impact. Perhaps breaking down your tasks into smaller chunks could help you feel more in control?",
            "Student": "That sounds like a good idea. I could definitely try to manage my time better.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! And remember, it’s also okay to ask for help when needed. Have you talked to your team about your concerns?",
            "Student": "Not yet. I’m worried they might think I’m not capable enough.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to have those fears, but open communication with your team can lead to better collaboration. It might also relieve some pressure for you.",
            "Student": "I’ll think about reaching out; thank you.",
            "Counselor": "You’re welcome, Ethan! It’s great that you're recognizing these feelings. Let’s check in again soon. How’s next week for you?",
            "Student": "Next week works for me! I’ll see you then."

            "Student": "Hi again, Counselor. It’s Ethan. I’ve been feeling really stressed this past week.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Ethan! I’m glad to see you back. I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling stressed. What’s been going on?",
            "Student": "Managing my coursework and the sustainability project is getting to me. We had a disagreement during a study group session.",
            "Counselor": "I can see how that would be frustrating. How did that disagreement make you feel?",
            "Student": "I felt unsupported and frustrated, especially since I value harmony in the group.",
            "Counselor": "It’s tough when conflicts arise in teamwork. Have you had a chance to address the disagreement with your team?",
            "Student": "No, I’ve been avoiding it. I’m not sure how to approach it without causing more issues.",
            "Counselor": "Avoiding the conversation can sometimes make things worse. Consider framing it as a way to find common ground rather than focusing on the conflict.",
            "Student": "That sounds reasonable, but I still feel anxious about it.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely valid. Perhaps practicing what you want to say beforehand could help you feel more prepared.",
            "Student": "I could do that. Thanks for the suggestion.",
            "Counselor": "You’re welcome! Taking small steps is key. Remember to care for your own well-being as well. Have you found time for any of your hobbies?",
            "Student": "Not really. I’m too wrapped up in stress.",
            "Counselor": "Making time for activities you enjoy is essential for managing stress. Try setting aside even a small amount of time for something you love."

            "Student": "Hey, it’s Ethan again. I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Ethan! It’s good to see you. I'm sorry to hear you’re feeling overwhelmed. What’s happening?",
            "Student": "Midterms are coming up, and I’m trying to juggle my studies with the project. It’s just a lot.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Balancing exams and a project can create a lot of pressure. What’s been the most stressful part for you?",
            "Student": "I overheard Alex making some negative remarks about my contributions, which made me feel heartbroken and lonely.",
            "Counselor": "I’m really sorry to hear that. It’s hurtful when others speak negatively. How did that affect your motivation?",
            "Student": "It’s made me doubt myself and my abilities, and I feel like withdrawing from both the project and my friends.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are valid. But remember, this experience doesn’t define your worth. Have you reached out to any friends or classmates for support?",
            "Student": "I haven’t. I feel embarrassed.",
            "Counselor": "It’s okay to feel embarrassed, but sharing your feelings with a close friend could offer relief and perspective. You are not alone in these struggles.",
            "Student": "I see your point. I’ll try to open up more.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a great decision! Alongside that, consider focusing on your strengths and what you bring to the project."

            "Counselor": "Hi Ethan! I’m really glad to see you again. How did the conversation go?",
            "Student": "It felt relieving to share my feelings about the project and my need for harmony.",
            "Counselor": "That’s wonderful to hear! How did Dr. Lewis respond?",
            "Student": "They were really understanding and provided me with communication strategies. I feel a bit more empowered now.",
            "Counselor": "That’s great! Having those strategies can help a lot. What are your plans going forward?",
            "Student": "I’m going to express my concerns openly with my project team. I think that will ease my mind.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a proactive step! How do you feel about having that conversation now?",
            "Student": "I’m still anxious, but I feel hopeful that addressing these issues will help me grow.",
            "Counselor": "Hope is a great feeling to lean on. Have you managed to find any time for your hobbies since our last chat?",
            "Student": "Yes! I went cycling this weekend, and it felt fantastic.",
            "Counselor": "That’s wonderful! Keeping up with activities you enjoy is important. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made.",
            "Student": "Thank you! I appreciate your ongoing support. I feel ready to tackle these challenges."
