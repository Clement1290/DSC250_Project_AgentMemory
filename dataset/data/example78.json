            "Student": "Hi, I’m Isabella Rojas. It’s so nice to meet you!",
            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! It’s great to meet you too. How are you doing today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a little excited but also kind of anxious about the new semester.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Starting a new semester always brings a mix of emotions. What’s on your mind?",
            "Student": "I’m working on a big communications project about cultural representation in media, and I'm excited about it, but I feel like my group may not be as committed as I am.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a significant project! Can you tell me more about your group dynamics?",
            "Student": "One member, Kyle, keeps dismissing my ideas, which really frustrates me. I’m worried about how it's going to affect our project’s success.",
            "Counselor": "I can see how that would be frustrating. Have you had a chance to speak with Kyle about how his comments make you feel?",
            "Student": "Not yet. I’m afraid of confrontation and how it might impact the group dynamic.",
            "Counselor": "It’s normal to have those fears. But discussing how you feel could strengthen the group. Would you like to explore ways to approach this conversation?"

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I’ve been feeling pretty isolated lately.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! I’m glad to see you again. What’s been making you feel isolated?",
            "Student": "The group project is really stressful. I can’t seem to get Kyle to take my ideas seriously, and it’s wearing me down.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really challenging. Have you had any discussions with your friend Sarah about it?",
            "Student": "Yes, she encourages me to talk to Kyle, but I still feel embarrassed to confront him.",
            "Counselor": "I understand that feeling. It’s tough to speak up when you’re afraid of how it might affect things. What do you think would happen if you did talk to him?",
            "Student": "I worry he’ll think I’m being too sensitive or overreacting.",
            "Counselor": "Those worries are common, but sometimes a little vulnerability can go a long way. Would it help to plan what you want to say in advance?",
            "Student": "That could help. I just want to express how his comments affect my confidence without causing drama."

            "Student": "Hi again. I’m feeling really down today.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! I’m here for you. What’s been bothering you this time?",
            "Student": "I presented my ideas in the last meeting, but Kyle interrupted me repeatedly and made sarcastic comments.",
            "Counselor": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been very hurtful to have your ideas dismissed like that. How did you feel during and after the meeting?",
            "Student": "I felt humiliated and discouraged. I’m wondering if I should just step back from the project altogether.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel conflicted about your role when faced with such challenges. Have you talked to anyone else in your group about what happened?",
            "Student": "Not yet. I don’t want to create tension but I also feel like I need to address it somewhere.",
            "Counselor": "That makes sense. Would it be more comforting to reach out to someone who might understand your position, like Sarah? She could provide support and encouragement.",
            "Student": "I’ll think about it. I just want to feel valued and not invisible in my group."

            "Student": "Hi! I’ve been thinking a lot since we last talked.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! I’m glad you returned. What reflections do you have?",
            "Student": "I’ve decided I need to confront Kyle about how I've been feeling and the group's dynamic.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a courageous choice! I’m proud of you for considering it. How do you feel about approaching him now?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit nervous, but also hopeful that it might lead to a better understanding.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a healthy mindset. What’s your plan for starting that conversation?",
            "Student": "I want to be honest and share how his comments affect my contributions, while also emphasizing that I value the project.",
            "Counselor": "That’s an excellent approach. It focuses on collaboration and your commitment to the work. How can I support you through this?",
            "Student": "Maybe after I talk to him, we can discuss how it went? I’d want some feedback.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! I’d love to hear how it goes. Just remember, no matter the outcome, taking this step is a sign of your growth."
