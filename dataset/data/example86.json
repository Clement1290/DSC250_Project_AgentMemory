            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit frustrated with my new semester in psychology.",
            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. What’s been frustrating you?",
            "Student": "I’m working on a group project about mental health awareness, but one of my teammates, Sarah, seems really disengaged.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds tough. Have you had a chance to talk to Sarah about how you feel?"

            "Student": "I tried to take more initiative in the project, but when I encouraged Sarah to share her thoughts, she dismissed me.",
            "Counselor": "That must have been discouraging. How did that make you feel?",
            "Student": "It made me anxious about leading the group. I’m worried I won’t be able to connect with my teammates.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you thought about how you might approach the group again?"

            "Student": "With the deadline approaching, I’ve been working late nights to keep the project on track. During a rehearsal today, I stumbled on my presentation and felt embarrassed.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really overwhelming. It's tough when you put in so much effort and feel unsupported. Have you reached out to anyone in your group for help?",
            "Student": "Not really. I don’t want to add to their stress, and I feel ashamed for struggling."

            "Counselor": "It’s good to hear that you reached out to your family. How did they respond?",
            "Student": "They encouraged me to talk openly with my teammates about how I’m feeling. But I still feel conflicted about confronting them.",
            "Counselor": "It's normal to feel conflicted. Remember, communication can lead to better understanding and help resolve your concerns. Have you thought about what you want to say?",
            "Student": "I’ve thought about it, but I'm still unsure about how to approach it.",
            "Counselor": "Take your time to organize your thoughts. You could write down what you want to say to help clarify your feelings. I believe you can do this."
