            "Counselor": "Hello, Elena! Great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit embarrassed, actually. I had my first group presentation yesterday, and I forgot some key points.",
            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. Presentations can be intense. How did your classmates react?",
            "Student": "One of my teammates, Emma, laughed a bit when I forgot. It made me feel really self-conscious.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds hurtful. It’s tough to feel sidelined during something as important as a presentation. How are you processing that experience?",
            "Student": "I’m frustrated and starting to question if I’m cut out for this major. I thought I was confident."

            "Student": "Hey again. I’m feeling more anxious now. It’s hard for me to participate in group discussions.",
            "Counselor": "It's good to see you again, Elena. What’s been happening since our last conversation?",
            "Student": "After the presentation, I’ve been withdrawing from group chats and discussions. I talked to my friend Kevin about feeling like I don’t belong.",
            "Counselor": "It’s really important that you’re reaching out to your friends about how you feel. It can help maintain those connections. How did Kevin respond?",
            "Student": "He tried to encourage me, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m just not good enough.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are common after a setback. Have you thought about ways to ease back into participating more actively?"

            "Counselor": "I appreciate you coming back, Elena. What concerns are weighing on you as midterms get closer?",
            "Student": "I feel lost and think about dropping the marketing club. I’m scared of failing in front of everyone.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about your studies and anxiety about performance?",
            "Student": "I’ve only talked to my family, but I feel trapped in my negative thoughts. I can’t seem to shake them off.",
            "Counselor": "It's often challenging to escape those thoughts. What if you set smaller, achievable goals for your study sessions?"

            "Student": "I want to express how anxious I am and seek support for the group project.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling about initiating this conversation with your professor?",
            "Student": "I’m nervous but also hopeful. I realize I can’t tackle this alone.",
            "Counselor": "It takes courage to ask for help, and doing so can empower you. Remember, your feelings are valid.",
