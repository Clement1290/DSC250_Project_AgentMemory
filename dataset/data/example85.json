            "Counselor": "That sounds disheartening. It’s hard when you put in effort and don’t get the response you hoped for. Have you considered how you might approach your classmates again?",

            "Counselor": "That’s a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed under such pressure. Have you talked to anyone in your group about your feelings?",
            "Student": "No, I don’t want to worry them. I just feel embarrassed."
