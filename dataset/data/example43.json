            "Student": "Hi, I'm Amara ElSayed. This is my first time here.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Amara! It's great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "Honestly, I’m feeling quite anxious about starting my senior year. I’m worried about what’s next after graduation.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Senior year can be a time of uncertainty. What specific concerns are on your mind?",
            "Student": "I have a strong desire to make a difference in cultural advocacy, but I’m feeling overwhelmed with uncertainty about job prospects in my field.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot of pressure to succeed, especially given your passion for cultural advocacy. Have you thought about what you would like to do after graduation?",
            "Student": "Not really. I feel left behind because many of my friends have accepted internships or job offers already.",
            "Counselor": "It’s normal to feel like you’re falling behind when your peers seem to have things figured out. Remember, everyone's journey is different. Have you considered talking to someone about potential opportunities?",
            "Student": "I haven’t, but it’s a good idea. I guess I just need to figure things out on my own.",
            "Counselor": "It’s okay to seek guidance. There are often resources available through your school that can help connect you with career advice. Would you be open to exploring that?",
            "Student": "Yeah, I suppose I could reach out for advice from my professors or career services.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a great step! Building connections can open doors for you. How does that sound?",
            "Student": "It sounds good. I’ll try to do that. Thank you for your support.",
            "Counselor": "You're welcome, Amara! Remember, seeking help shows strength. I’m here for you if you need to talk again."

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I wanted to talk about a conference I attended recently.",
            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Amara! How did the conference go for you?",
            "Student": "It was overwhelming. I was surrounded by other students confidently presenting their ideas, and I felt really out of place.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds tough. It’s easy to feel isolated when you’re in an environment where others are expressing themselves so openly. What emotions did that bring up for you?",
            "Student": "I felt frustrated and insecure. I wanted to share my ideas, but I hesitated because I feared they wouldn’t be good enough.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a common feeling, especially in a competitive environment. It might help to explore why you felt that way. What made you doubt your contributions?",
            "Student": "I guess it’s just the pressure I put on myself to succeed and not measure up to my peers.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel pressured, especially with your aspirations in cultural advocacy. Have you thought about how you could express your ideas more confidently in the future?",
            "Student": "I could prepare more before speaking up and remind myself that my voice matters too.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! Practicing what you want to say beforehand might help you feel more empowered. How will you apply that in the next opportunity?",
            "Student": "I’ll definitely try that! Thanks for your encouragement.",
            "Counselor": "Of course! Remember that your experiences and thoughts are valuable. I’m here if you want to talk again."

            "Student": "Hi again. I wanted to share something that happened during a dinner I hosted.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Amara! I’m glad you’re here. How was the dinner?",
            "Student": "I invited my classmates over, and it turned into a conversation about their internships. I felt overwhelmed when they talked about their achievements.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds challenging. It’s tough to hear others’ successes when you’re feeling unsure about your own path. How did that affect you during the evening?",
            "Student": "I started feeling helpless. I just wanted to be happy for them, but I couldn’t help feeling disappointed in myself.",
            "Counselor": "It’s normal to feel that way in competitive scenarios. When you stepped away to gather your thoughts, what reflections came to you?",
            "Student": "I realized how much I’ve been questioning my own progress and if I’m even good enough to succeed in this field.",
            "Counselor": "It’s important to recognize those feelings. Remember that it’s okay to feel lost; many people experience doubts. What do you think could help you shift your focus back to yourself?",
            "Student": "Maybe I should write down my achievements, however small they might be, to remind myself of my progress.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a powerful exercise! Acknowledging your growth can help build your confidence. How do you feel about starting that?",
            "Student": "I think it’s a good idea. Thank you for the suggestion!"

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I spoke with my brother, Khaled, about everything I’ve been feeling.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Amara! I'm glad you're here again. How did your conversation go?",
            "Student": "It was supportive. He suggested I think about talking to a career counselor for advice, but I still feel unsure about reaching out.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a positive step, and I’m glad you have Khaled’s support. What concerns do you have about seeking help?",
            "Student": "I worry that it might reveal my uncertainties and make me feel even more vulnerable.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to feel that way, but seeking help is a sign of strength. Career counselors are there to guide you, not judge you. What resonates with you about that idea?",
            "Student": "Knowing they’re there to support me makes it seem less scary. I just want to make sure I’m going in the right direction.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! Taking that step could provide you the clarity you’re seeking. How you think you might approach setting up that meeting?",
            "Student": "I could start by looking up appointments online or asking my professors for a recommendation.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a great plan! You’ve got this, Amara. Just remember to take it one step at a time.",
            "Student": "Thank you for believing in me! I feel more hopeful after talking it through."
