            "Student": "Hi, I'm Ethan Chen. This is my first time here.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Ethan! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling as you start your senior year?",
            "Student": "I’m a bit anxious, actually. There’s a lot of pressure with graduate applications coming up.",
            "Counselor": "That makes sense. Senior year can be stressful. What specifically is weighing on your mind right now?",
            "Student": "I feel overwhelmed with the need to secure strong recommendations and to present myself well. My mom has high expectations for me.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like there are a lot of expectations being placed on you. How does that affect your feelings about your future?",
            "Student": "It's making me feel insecure about whether I can truly meet those expectations. I keep questioning if I’m good enough.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are valid, Ethan. Many students experience this pressure. Have you thought about how you might cope with these feelings?",
            "Student": "Maybe I could try breaking down the application process into smaller, manageable steps.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a great idea! Setting smaller goals can help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about starting that approach?",
            "Student": "That makes me feel a little better. Thank you for the suggestion!",
            "Counselor": "You’re welcome! Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. Let’s take it one step at a time together."

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I went to a leadership event, and it didn’t go as planned.",
            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Ethan! I’m here to listen. What happened at the leadership event?",
            "Student": "I was supposed to speak, but I stumbled over my words and couldn’t get my point across.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really tough. How did that make you feel in the moment and afterward?",
            "Student": "I felt embarrassed and frustrated. I overheard my peers discussing their accomplishments, and it just made me feel more inadequate.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to feel discouraged when you’re comparing yourself to others. Did you reach out to anyone afterward for support?",
            "Student": "No, I didn’t want to burden anyone with my feelings of failure.",
            "Counselor": "It’s common to feel like you’re burdening others, but talking about your feelings can help. What do you think about reaching out to a friend?",
            "Student": "I guess talking might help, even if it’s just a little. I just wish I could erase that feeling of inadequacy.",
            "Counselor": "It's okay to have those feelings, and expressing them can sometimes lessen their intensity. How do you feel about setting a goal to share your feelings with a friend next week?"

            "Student": "Hi, I wanted to talk about my experiences volunteering at a community center.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Ethan! I’m glad you’re here to share. How was your volunteering experience?",
            "Student": "It was eye-opening, but I also felt overwhelmed. I met youth who are really engaged in advocacy, and it left me questioning my own contributions.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds impactful but also challenging. How did that affect you emotionally?",
            "Student": "Instead of feeling motivated, I ended up feeling discouraged and unsure of my value in this field.",
            "Counselor": "It’s common to feel that way when you’re comparing yourself to those with more experience. What might help you focus on your strengths instead?",
            "Student": "I could remind myself that everyone has to start somewhere. I have my own experiences and passions that matter too.",
            "Counselor": "Exactly! Reflecting on your unique contributions can help you feel more confident. What small action could you take to celebrate your progress?",
            "Student": "Maybe I could write down some of my achievements or volunteer experiences to remind myself of the impact I’ve made."

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I talked to my sister Mai about my feelings of inadequacy.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Ethan! I’m glad you’re here again. How did that conversation go?",
            "Student": "It went well. I shared my worries, and she suggested I seek mentorship opportunities in my field.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a great suggestion! Mentorship can provide valuable guidance. How do you feel about reaching out for that kind of support?",
            "Student": "I think it's a good idea, but I’m still hesitant. What if I’m seen as inexperienced?",
            "Counselor": "It’s normal to feel nervous, but remember that mentors are there to help you grow. What can you do to support yourself in that decision?",
            "Student": "I could remind myself that everyone has to learn and grow. Maybe I could write out what I want to gain from a mentor.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a strong approach! It can help clarify your expectations and make the conversation feel more structured. Are you ready to explore mentorship further?"
