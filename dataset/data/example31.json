            "Student": "Hi, I’m Isabella Martinez. This is my first time here.",
            "Counselor": "Hello Isabella! It’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I just started my final year in Art History.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a big step! What’s been on your mind?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a lot of pressure with my thesis project and also worried about my friend, Sarah, who just lost a family member.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a heavy load to carry. Balancing these responsibilities can be really tough. How have you been managing that?",
            "Student": "I’m not sure. I’m feeling stressed and obligated to be there for Sarah while focusing on my work.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are completely valid. Have you found moments to take care of yourself amid all of this?",
            "Student": "Not really, I just feel guilty taking time for myself.",
            "Counselor": "Guilt over self-care is very common, but it's actually vital for your well-being. Would you consider scheduling short breaks for yourself?"

            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Isabella! How have you been since our last session?",
            "Student": "I'm still feeling guilty. I want to support Sarah, but I'm falling behind in my studies.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a difficult situation. What has you feeling especially guilty?",
            "Student": "I keep getting distracted by her problems, and now I'm stressing about my grades.",
            "Counselor": "It's understandable to want to help a friend, but it's also important to maintain your own focus. Have you had a chance to talk to Sarah about how you're feeling?",
            "Student": "No, I haven't. I fear she might think I don’t care enough.",
            "Counselor": "It's a common concern, but being open might actually strengthen your friendship. Maybe she’ll appreciate your honesty about managing your responsibilities.",
            "Student": "That could help. I’ll think about reaching out to her."

            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! Welcome back. How have things been for you?",
            "Student": "Really tough. I had a confrontation with Sarah, and it left me feeling hurt.",
            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. What happened during your conversation?",
            "Student": "She got upset because I haven't been there for her as much, and now I feel misunderstood and distanced from her.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really painful. It’s hard when someone you care about feels neglected. Have you thought about reaching out again to clarify your feelings?",
            "Student": "I've been avoiding her. I feel incredibly isolated now and doubt my ability to handle both friendship and school.",
            "Counselor": "Isolation can be a heavy burden. Remember, it's okay to express to Sarah that you also have your own challenges. Reaching out could help mend misunderstandings."

            "Counselor": "Hi Isabella! I’m glad you came back. What’s been going on since we last met?",
            "Student": "I participated in a workshop on mental health, and it made me realize I’ve been neglecting my self-care.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a meaningful experience! How does that realization make you feel about seeking help?",
            "Student": "I feel both hopeful and apprehensive. I want to prioritize my mental health, but I'm scared to open up to others.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are entirely valid. Seeking help is often seen as a sign of strength. Would you like to explore some strategies for reaching out for support?",
            "Student": "Yes, please. I think I need help figuring out how to start that conversation."
