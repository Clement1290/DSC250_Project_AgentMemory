            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. I just started the new semester.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely understandable. Starting a new semester can bring a lot of pressure. What’s been concerning you?",
            "Student": "I’ve received my syllabus and it looks like I have a lot of projects and assignments coming up. It’s stressing me out.",
            "Counselor": "It's common to feel anxious when faced with a heavy workload. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about your feelings?",
            "Student": "I mentioned it to my mom during dinner, but I still feel a lot of pressure to keep my grades up to maintain my scholarship."

            "Student": "I'm struggling with time management. I felt really intimidated in a group project, and I found it hard to speak up.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds frustrating to deal with such pressure in group dynamics. Can you tell me more about what happened?",
            "Student": "There’s a classmate, Sarah, who tends to dominate discussions. I got so nervous that I just didn’t contribute.",
            "Counselor": "That can be really tough. Have you thought about ways to assert yourself in group settings?",
            "Student": "I guess I could try preparing my ideas in advance, but it’s just hard to break through the anxiety."

            "Student": "With midterms coming up, I feel pressure, and I’ve been declining invites to hang out. I miss hanging out with my friends and family.",
            "Counselor": "It’s common to isolate yourself during stressful times, but connection is important, too. How did you feel when your sister Aanya invited you to an event recently?",
            "Student": "I told her I was too busy. I feel guilty for missing out on family time and worry they think I don’t care.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way. It’s okay to communicate your struggles to them. Your family wants to support you."
