            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. What’s been bothering you?",
            "Student": "I joined a group project on renewable energy sources, but one of my teammates, Alex, has been missing meetings and not contributing at all.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds challenging. Have you had a chance to speak with him about it?",
            "Student": "I tried reaching out to him, but he hasn’t responded. I’m worried about how this will affect our project’s success."

            "Counselor": "That’s a lot to handle! Have you spoken up about how you’re feeling during group meetings?",
            "Student": "I tried, but my classmates said I was being too sensitive about Alex's participation. Now I'm feeling anxious about addressing any conflicts.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel anxious, especially when you’re trying to ensure the project succeeds. How about writing down your thoughts to prepare for the next meeting?"

            "Counselor": "That sounds really tough. It’s hard when you put in so much effort and still feel unsupported. Have you reached out to anyone for help?",
            "Student": "Not really. I don’t want to burden my friends, and I feel ashamed for struggling.",

            "Student": "They were really supportive and shared their struggles too. It felt good to connect over our challenges, but I'm still uncertain about my leadership abilities.",
            "Counselor": "It’s normal to feel uncertain after such experiences. Have you considered what kind of support you might need to develop your leadership style?",
            "Student": "I’m thinking about reaching out for professional guidance, but I’m still hesitant.",
            "Counselor": "Taking that step shows strength and a desire to grow, which is commendable. I encourage you to pursue it when you feel ready.",
