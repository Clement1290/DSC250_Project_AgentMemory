            "Student": "Hi, I’m Elias Thompson. It’s nice to meet you.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Elias! It’s great to meet you too. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "Honestly, I'm feeling quite disillusioned about my future. I'm a senior in philosophy, and I'm not sure where to go from here.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really challenging. What specifically is making you feel disillusioned?",
            "Student": "I feel pressured to finalize my plans, but I have no clear direction. My friends seem to have it all figured out, and I feel lost.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially as graduation approaches. Have you had a chance to think about what you truly want?",
            "Student": "Not really. Every time I think about it, I feel overwhelmed. My dad wants me to pursue a more secure career, which adds to the pressure.",
            "Counselor": "Navigating family expectations can be tough. It's important to explore what's fulfilling for you, not just what seems secure."

            "Student": "Hi again. I’m really anxious about the upcoming career fair. I don’t know if I fit into the corporate world.",
            "Counselor": "Hi, Elias! It’s good to see you again. What’s making you anxious about the career fair?",
            "Student": "I keep oscillating between wanting to explore opportunities and feeling like I wouldn’t belong in a corporate setting.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a powerful conflict to navigate. Have you talked to your friends or family about these feelings?",
            "Student": "I’m hesitant. My sister Hannah suggests applying philosophy to fields like ethics, but I don’t know if that resonates with me.",
            "Counselor": "It's okay to not resonate with every suggestion. Maybe there's a way to find common ground between your interests and possible careers.",
            "Student": "I wish I could find that balance, but right now I just feel pressured and isolated from my friends."

            "Student": "Hello again. I just took a trip to the park to clear my mind, but I still feel lost.",
            "Counselor": "Hi, Elias! It's great that you took some time to reflect in nature. How did your trip go?",
            "Student": "I ran into an old friend, who seemed to have everything figured out. It made me feel even more frustrated about my own path.",
            "Counselor": "It’s tough to see others thriving when you’re feeling stuck. How did that interaction affect your mood?",
            "Student": "It made me long for some direction. I tried to write poetry afterward, but the words just wouldn’t come.",
            "Counselor": "Writer’s block can happen, especially when you’re feeling pressured. It might help to write without judgment or specific expectations."

            "Student": "Hi, I survived the career fair, but it was overwhelming.",
            "Counselor": "Hi, Elias! I’m glad to see you again. How did it go?",
            "Student": "It was a mix of excitement and dread. I hesitated to approach employers and felt unsure of my worth.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Putting yourself out there takes courage. Did you find any opportunities that interested you?",
            "Student": "I managed to speak with a few representatives, but they focused on my resume instead of my creative interests.",
            "Counselor": "It can be disheartening when your unique interests aren’t acknowledged. Have you had a chance to discuss this experience with anyone else?",
            "Student": "Afterward, I talked to Hannah, and she encouraged me to embrace my unique perspective. But I'm still conflicted about my path.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a positive conversation. Embracing your unique perspective can lead you to opportunities aligned with your values. Remember, it’s okay to take time to find your way."
