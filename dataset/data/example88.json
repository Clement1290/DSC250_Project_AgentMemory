            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. What’s been particularly frustrating for you?",
            "Student": "We have a group project on mental health awareness, and one of my teammates, Liam, seems really disengaged.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds challenging. Have you had a chance to reach out to Liam about how you’re feeling?"

            "Student": "I tried to take the lead by presenting my ideas in the last meeting, but everyone seemed indifferent and unresponsive, especially Liam.",
            "Counselor": "That must be discouraging. How did that make you feel?",
            "Student": "It made me anxious about my ability to lead the group. I doubt my capacity to motivate my teammates.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are completely valid. Leadership can be tough, especially when you want to inspire others. Have you considered how you might try to engage your team again?"

            "Student": "With the project deadline nearing, I’ve taken on most of the work, hoping to compensate for Liam and others. My presentation rehearsal went poorly, and I felt embarrassed afterward.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds incredibly overwhelming, especially when you’ve put in so much effort. Have you reached out to anyone in your group for help or support?",
            "Student": "No, I don't want to add to their stress. I feel so isolated right now."

            "Counselor": "I’m glad to hear that, Sophia! How did it feel sharing your struggles with your family?",
            "Student": "It felt relieving, but I’m still unsure about how to approach my team. I want to communicate honestly but without causing more tension.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a thoughtful approach. Remember, open communication can help foster understanding. What do you think you’ll say to them?",
            "Student": "I want to express my feelings but I’m not sure how to frame it.",
            "Counselor": "Perhaps you could write down your thoughts. It might help organize what you want to communicate. You can do this, I believe in you!"
