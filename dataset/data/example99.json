            "Student": "Hi, I'm Daniela Garcia. I'm 21 and majoring in biology.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Daniela! It's great to meet you. How's your semester going so far?",
            "Student": "Thanks! I'm feeling excited about my classes, but I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Starting a new semester can be both exciting and challenging. What has you feeling overwhelmed?",
            "Student": "The coursework is more demanding than I expected. I’m also trying to balance my hobbies and volunteering.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. How have you been managing your time so far?",
            "Student": "I’m trying to keep up, but I sometimes doubt my ability to handle everything.",
            "Counselor": "It's common to feel that way, especially with so many commitments. Have you considered prioritizing your tasks or breaking them into smaller goals?",
            "Student": "I think that might help. I just don't want to let anyone down.",
            "Counselor": "It’s admirable that you care about others, but remember to take care of yourself too. Finding a balance is key. Let’s explore some strategies together."

            "Student": "Hi again. I’m feeling more anxious lately. My stress is increasing.",
            "Counselor": "I'm glad you reached out, Daniela. What's been causing your stress?",
            "Student": "I feel isolated, especially during group projects. Liam keeps dominating discussions, and it makes me feel overshadowed.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds frustrating. It can be really difficult when someone else takes the lead. How did that make you feel about your contributions?",
            "Student": "It hit my self-esteem hard. I tried to share my ideas, but I felt like no one noticed.",
            "Counselor": "It's understandable to feel that way. Have you talked to anyone else in your group about your feelings?",
            "Student": "Not yet. I'm scared they might think I'm just being sensitive.",
            "Counselor": "Your feelings are valid, and communication is key. Perhaps you could express how you feel during your next meeting. You deserve to be heard."

            "Student": "Hello again. I tried to take on a leadership role in a community service project, but I ended up feeling lost during the meeting.",
            "Counselor": "I'm sorry to hear that, Daniela. It can be intimidating to take the lead. What happened in the meeting?",
            "Student": "I got so nervous and struggled to articulate my vision. My classmates seemed supportive, but I felt they misunderstood my hesitation.",
            "Counselor": "That can certainly be disheartening. It's normal to feel nervous in leadership roles. Do you think preparation could help you feel more confident?",
            "Student": "Yeah, I think practicing what to say might help. But I can't shake off the feeling of inadequacy.",
            "Counselor": "It’s important to remember that everyone feels unsure at times. Have you thought about focusing on your strengths and what you bring to the table?",
            "Student": "I guess I could try to remind myself of that. It just feels tough right now."

            "Student": "Hi, I’ve had a rough week. I overheard Liam joking about me needing to 'come out of my shell.'",
            "Counselor": "Oh, Daniela, I'm really sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?",
            "Student": "It hurt a lot and made me feel angry. I can't believe he would say something like that.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely understandable. It's painful to hear negative comments about ourselves. Have you thought about confronting him?",
            "Student": "I want to, but I fear it might end badly. What if he just brushes it off?",
            "Counselor": "That fear is valid, and it’s okay to take your time to process. Sometimes expressing how you feel can open up a dialogue, but it’s also important to protect your emotional well-being.",
            "Student": "I’ve been turning to my art as a way to cope, but I still feel really isolated.",
            "Counselor": "Art can be a great way to express your feelings. Just remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here for you whenever you need support."
