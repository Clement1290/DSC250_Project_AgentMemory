            "Student": "Hi, I'm Elena Brooks. This is my first time in this counseling space.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Elena! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about the new semester.",
            "Counselor": "That’s quite normal! Starting a new semester can be both thrilling and overwhelming. What’s making you feel anxious?",
            "Student": "I’m involved in a lot of cultural initiatives alongside my International Relations classes. I worry about not being able to manage everything.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Have you had a chance to talk about how you’re feeling with anyone close to you?",
            "Student": "Not really. I feel guilty for even thinking about needing help when I should be able to handle it.",
            "Counselor": "It's important to remember that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. Would you be open to discussing some strategies that might help you manage everything?"

            "Student": "Hi again. I’ve been feeling even more stressed this week.",
            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Elena! I'm here to listen. What’s been happening this week?",
            "Student": "Deadlines are approaching, and I feel buried under my assignments. I've stopped hanging out with my friends, even my best friend Maya.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way with so much going on. How do you feel when you decline their invitations?",
            "Student": "I feel guilty and lonely. I want to spend time with them, but I keep telling myself I need more study time.",
            "Counselor": "It’s tough to find that balance. Taking breaks can actually help improve your focus and productivity. Have you considered setting aside specific times for both studying and spending time with friends?"

            "Student": "Hello, I had a really tough week.",
            "Counselor": "Hi, Elena! I’m sorry to hear that. What happened this week?",
            "Student": "I received disappointing feedback on a presentation, and I broke down during a group project. I ended up lashing out at Maya, who was just concerned about me.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds really stressful. How did that confrontation affect you?",
            "Student": "I felt defensive initially, but then I realized I might have hurt our friendship. I worry that my stress is pushing everyone away.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to react defensively when stressed, but acknowledging that is a good first step. Have you thought about reaching out to Maya to talk things through?"

            "Counselor": "That’s wonderful to hear, Elena! How did that conversation go?",
            "Student": "It was really meaningful. I opened up about my struggles, and she was very understanding. It felt good to be honest.",
            "Counselor": "That’s great! How are you feeling about your commitments now?",
            "Student": "I feel relieved after sharing, but I'm still anxious about my academic workload and keeping my friends close.",
            "Counselor": "It’s perfectly okay to have some anxiety. Perhaps taking small steps towards balance and communication can help you feel more at ease. Have you thought about how you will move forward?"
