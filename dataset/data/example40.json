            "Student": "Hi, I'm Sofia Ramirez. It's nice to meet you.",
            "Counselor": "Hello Sofia! It’s great to meet you too. How are you feeling as the new semester begins?",
            "Student": "I'm excited to start my Graphic Design courses, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed already.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable! What is making you feel overwhelmed?",
            "Student": "I have a lot of responsibilities with my classes and several volunteer projects. I don’t want to disappoint anyone.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Have you had a chance to talk about your concerns with anyone in your family or volunteer group?",
            "Student": "Not really. I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle things.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Sometimes talking about it can help. Have you thought about how you could manage your time better?",
            "Student": "I guess I should try making a schedule or something.",
            "Counselor": "Absolutely! Planning it out might help you feel more in control. What do you like to do when you have some free time?",
            "Student": "I enjoy painting and hiking, but it feels like I haven’t had time to do either lately.",
            "Counselor": "It’s important to make time for those activities. They can help you relax and recharge!"

            "Student": "Hi, it’s Sofia again. I’m feeling really stressed this week.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Sofia! I’m sorry to hear that. What’s been causing you stress?",
            "Student": "Midterms are coming up, and it’s hard to keep up with classes and the volunteer work.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a challenging situation. How has the volunteer work been for you?",
            "Student": "During a meeting, I shared my ideas for the upcoming art event, but one of my classmates, Emily, dismissed them, which upset me.",
            "Counselor": "That must have been difficult to hear. How did that affect your feelings about the group?",
            "Student": "I felt undervalued and started to question whether I even belong in that group.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are valid. Have you talked to anyone in the group about how you’re feeling?",
            "Student": "No, I’m scared they’ll think I’m being dramatic.",
            "Counselor": "Expressing how you feel doesn’t make you dramatic; it’s a part of open communication. Would you consider reaching out to a supportive friend from the group?",
            "Student": "I’ll think about it. Thank you for your understanding."

            "Student": "Hey, it’s Sofia. I’m really having a hard time today.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Sofia, I’m here to listen. What’s been going on?",
            "Student": "I got a disappointing grade on my last paper, and it made me feel terrible.",
            "Counselor": "I’m really sorry to hear that. How did it make you feel?",
            "Student": "It made me feel like I’m not cut out for this major. When I was in my group, Kevin criticized my ideas again.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds quite discouraging. Criticism can be tough, especially when paired with self-doubt. How did you respond to Kevin?",
            "Student": "I just kept quiet. I feel like I can’t share my ideas anymore.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel that way, but not sharing could lead you to feel even more isolated. Would it help to practice what you want to say before addressing Kevin again?",
            "Student": "I guess practicing might make it easier. I could use that to rebuild my confidence."

            "Student": "Hi, Counselor! I finally had a conversation with Dr. Garcia.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Sofia! How did the conversation go?",
            "Student": "I opened up about my feelings of pressure and the criticism I faced, and Dr. Garcia was really encouraging.",
            "Counselor": "That’s wonderful to hear! What advice did they give you?",
            "Student": "She emphasized the importance of being true to myself and not letting others' opinions define my worth.",
            "Counselor": "That’s an important lesson! How do you feel about approaching your group with that newfound perspective?",
            "Student": "I feel hopeful but still a bit anxious. I want to assert my ideas without conflict.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a valid feeling. Maybe try to frame it as sharing your thoughts rather than confrontation. Have you found time for any hobbies lately?",
            "Student": "I went hiking last weekend, and it was refreshing! I need to remember to take time for myself.",
            "Counselor": "That’s fantastic! Balancing work and personal interests is key to maintaining your well-being. I’m proud of your growth, Sofia!"
