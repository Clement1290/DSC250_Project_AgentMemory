            "Student": "Hi there, I'm Maya Patel. I believe this is my first session with you.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Maya! It's great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "Honestly, a bit anxious. I have midterms coming up, and I'm trying to keep up with everything.",
            "Counselor": "I understand that can be really overwhelming. What specifically is causing the most anxiety for you?",
            "Student": "I received a text from my friend inviting me on a hiking trip. I really want to go, but I feel guilty leaving my studies behind.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a tough situation. It’s always hard to balance enjoyment with responsibilities. Have you considered how a short break might help your studies?",
            "Student": "I know it might help in theory, but I worry about falling behind.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a valid concern. Sometimes a little time away can actually refresh your mind and improve focus. Do you enjoy hiking?",
            "Student": "Yes, I love being outdoors. It’s just hard to switch off my study mindset.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you could really benefit from that outdoor time. Balancing work and play is important. Would you feel better if you planned time for both?",
            "Student": "I guess I could plan ahead, but I still feel conflicted.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely normal to feel conflicted. What if you set limits on your study time to make sure you could participate in the trip without guilt?",
            "Student": "That sounds reasonable. I’ll try planning study blocks before I leave.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a great strategy! Remember, taking a break can actually boost productivity. Is there anything else on your mind?",
            "Student": "No, I think that’s it for now. Thank you for your help!",
            "Counselor": "You're very welcome, Maya. I’m glad I could offer some support. Let’s touch base again soon. Take care!"

            "Student": "Hi, it's me again, Maya.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Maya! Welcome back. How did the hiking trip go?",
            "Student": "It was nice, but I couldn’t really enjoy it. I kept thinking about my studies.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds frustrating. It can be tough to disconnect from responsibilities. Could you tell me more about what happened?",
            "Student": "I felt guilty for not studying, and it affected my mood. I ended up getting irritable with my friends.",
            "Counselor": "I can see how that would make the trip less enjoyable. It’s tough feeling guilt when you want to have fun. Did you manage to talk it through with your friends?",
            "Student": "Not really. I distanced myself from them during the campfire, and now I feel isolated.",
            "Counselor": "Isolating yourself can sometimes feel like a protective measure, but it can deepen feelings of loneliness. Have you thought about reaching out to them?",
            "Student": "I guess I should, but I'm embarrassed about how I acted.",
            "Counselor": "It's okay to feel that way. Remember that your friends care about you. They might understand what you were feeling.",
            "Student": "Maybe you're right. I’ll consider talking to them. Thanks for the encouragement!",
            "Counselor": "You're welcome! Just remember, everyone has moments where they feel off. It’s part of being human. Do you feel more at ease thinking about it?",
            "Student": "A bit, yes. Thank you for listening.",
            "Counselor": "Anytime! I'm here for you. Let’s chat again soon to see how you’re feeling."

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back.",
            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Maya! How have you been since our last session?",
            "Student": "Not great, to be honest. My grades are slipping, and I feel really depressed about it.",
            "Counselor": "I’m sorry to hear that. It must be tough feeling this way, especially after the hiking trip. Would you like to share more about what’s been affecting you?",
            "Student": "After the trip, I couldn’t concentrate at all. I ended up arguing with my brother Arjun about my studies.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds difficult. It’s tough when family members don’t seem to understand the pressure you’re under. How did the conversation go?",
            "Student": "He was just trying to help, but I felt hurt and misunderstood. Now I feel even more alienated from my family.",
            "Counselor": "Feeling alienated can be really painful. Have you considered talking to Arjun about how you felt during that argument?",
            "Student": "I don’t know; I feel like he just won’t get it.",
            "Counselor": "It might feel that way now, but opening up can sometimes lead to better understanding. It shows vulnerability, which can strengthen bonds.",
            "Student": "I see your point. I just worry it’ll lead to more conflict.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a valid concern, but communication is key. Your feelings are valid. Have you thought about writing a letter if talking seems too daunting?",
            "Student": "That could be easier for me. I think I'll give that a try.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a good approach. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling. It’s part of the process."

            "Counselor": "Hi Maya! It’s good to see you. How have things been since our last session?",
            "Student": "I still feel overwhelmed. I reached out to Priya, but I struggled to open up about my feelings.",
            "Counselor": "Opening up can indeed be challenging. It’s a process that takes time. How did Priya respond?",
            "Student": "She suggested I see a counselor, which makes sense, but I feel embarrassed about it.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely normal to feel that way. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Many people do it.",
            "Student": "I get that, but I still feel resistant to the idea.",
            "Counselor": "Resistance is common. You could think about it as a step toward self-care rather than a label of weakness.",
            "Student": "That perspective helps. I guess I just worry about what others will think.",
            "Counselor": "Your mental health is the priority. If seeking help can support you, it’s worth overcoming that fear. You’re not alone in this.",
            "Student": "I appreciate your reassurance. It makes it easier to think about.",
            "Counselor": "That’s great to hear! Just remember, it’s okay to take your time. Acknowledge how far you’ve come.",
            "Student": "Thank you for being here; it really helps me feel less alone.",
            "Counselor": "I’m glad to support you, Maya. Take your time with this, and we can talk more whenever you need."
