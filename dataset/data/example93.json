            "Counselor": "Hello, Ava! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed to be honest. I just started the semester.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely understandable. Starting a new semester can be a lot to handle. What’s been on your mind?",
            "Student": "After going through the syllabus, I see I have so many projects and deadlines coming up. It’s kind of scary.",
            "Counselor": "It can be intimidating to look at a full schedule like that. Have you been able to share your feelings with anyone?",
            "Student": "I talked to my mom about it, but I still feel a lot of pressure. I want to perform well and keep my scholarship.",
            "Counselor": "It’s commendable to have high aspirations, but it’s also important to balance those expectations. What do you think would help ease your stress?"

            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Ava! I appreciate you coming in. Can you tell me more about what’s been difficult for you?",
            "Student": "In group projects, I’m hesitant to share my ideas. I feel like I don’t measure up to my classmates, especially Lisa who is very assertive.",
            "Counselor": "It’s tough to feel overshadowed like that. Have you thought about how you could communicate your ideas more assertively?",
            "Student": "I haven’t really. It’s hard to find the courage when I feel so insecure.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely normal to feel that way, but you have valuable insights to share. Perhaps you can prepare your thoughts ahead of meetings to build your confidence.",
            "Student": "That could help. I just worry they won’t find my ideas important."

            "Student": "As midterms approach, I feel overwhelmed with work. I’ve been declining invites to hang out and now I worry I'm missing out.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to want to focus on your studies, but social connections are also important. How did you feel when you turned down your brother’s invitation?",
            "Student": "I feel guilty, especially since he looks up to me. I want to be there for him like he’s been for me.",
            "Counselor": "Family relationships can be difficult during stressful times. It's okay to be honest with him about your struggles. Have you considered talking to him about how you're feeling?",
            "Student": "I’ve thought about it, but I fear it will worry him more."
