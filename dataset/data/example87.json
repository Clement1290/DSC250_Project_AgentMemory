            "Counselor": "I'm sorry to hear that. What’s been especially frustrating?",
            "Student": "I was excited about this group project on global humanitarian efforts, but one teammate, Alex, seems completely disengaged.",

            "Counselor": "That’s really tough. It’s natural to feel anxious in that situation. How have you been managing those feelings?",
            "Student": "I’ve been trying to take more control, but I keep doubting if I can motivate anyone.",
            "Counselor": "It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you want to ensure everyone is engaged. Have you thought about reaching out to the rest of your group for support?"

            "Student": "With the deadline approaching, I've been working late trying to cover for Alex and others. During our last rehearsal, I stumbled through my presentation. I felt so embarrassed.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds incredibly tough, especially when you’ve put in so much effort. Have you communicated how you're feeling to your team?",
            "Student": "No, I don’t want to add more pressure or seem weak. I just feel so isolated."

            "Student": "I feel a bit relieved talking about it, but I’m still conflicted about how to approach my teammates. I want to address it without causing more tension.",
            "Counselor": "That's very thoughtful of you. Remember that honesty can often lead to a better understanding. What do you think you’ll say to them?",
            "Student": "I think I need to express my feelings honestly but respectfully. It’s just hard to find the right words.",
            "Counselor": "Take your time to gather your thoughts. Perhaps jot down some points you want to cover. I believe you can facilitate a meaningful conversation."
