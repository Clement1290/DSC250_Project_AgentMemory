            "Counselor": "Hello, Nina! It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling a bit anxious, honestly. I just started the semester.",
            "Counselor": "That’s quite normal. Starting a new semester can be overwhelming. What specifically is on your mind?",
            "Student": "I’m excited, but I’m also starting to feel the weight of expectations from my professors and family.",
            "Counselor": "I see. Can you share more about those expectations? How do they affect you?",
            "Student": "My mom mentioned my potential in healthcare during dinner, which made me feel pressured to succeed.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a lot of pressure. It's common for family expectations to create anxiety. Have you had a chance to talk to your family about how you’re feeling?"

            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Nina. I'm glad you came in. What’s been challenging this time?",
            "Student": "I’m feeling overwhelmed with assignments and time management. In a group project, I feel intimidated by one of my classmates, Andrew.",
            "Counselor": "It can be tough to feel overshadowed. What specifically makes you feel that way around Andrew?",
            "Student": "He often dominates the discussions, and I find it hard to share my ideas. It’s frustrating because I know I have something valuable to offer.",
            "Counselor": "That frustration is understandable. It’s important for you to feel heard. Have you considered strategies to express your ideas more confidently?"

            "Counselor": "Hi Nina! I appreciate you coming back. Can you elaborate on what's making you feel isolated?",
            "Student": "I’ve been focusing too much on my studies and have started to decline invitations to hang out. I miss my friends and family.",
            "Counselor": "It's common to withdraw when overwhelmed. How did it feel when your brother Luca reached out to you recently?",
            "Student": "I brushed him off, saying I was too busy. I regret not spending time with him. I feel guilty."
            "Counselor": "It's very normal to feel guilty about that. Your family cares about you, and balancing your social life and responsibilities is important. How do you think you could reconnect with them?"

            "Student": "I opened up about my anxiety and how I felt inadequate in group settings. It was really relieving.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a significant breakthrough! What advice did your advisor provide?",
            "Student": "They encouraged me to embrace my creativity and to actively participate without fear of judgment. They reminded me it’s okay to ask for help.",
            "Counselor": "Yes! That’s fantastic advice. How do you feel about implementing that and engaging more in your classes now?"
