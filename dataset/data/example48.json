            "Student": "Hi, I'm Priya Sharma. This is my first time visiting.",
            "Counselor": "Hello, Priya! It’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling as you start your senior year?",
            "Student": "Honestly, I’m feeling pretty anxious. There’s a lot of pressure to apply for graduate school.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds challenging. Senior year can be full of expectations. What’s specifically weighing heavy on your mind?",
            "Student": "I worry about meeting my family's high expectations, especially my mom’s. She often talks about my future in social work and it stresses me out.",
            "Counselor": "It’s completely natural to feel that pressure, especially from loved ones. How does that affect your confidence?",
            "Student": "It makes me feel insecure, like I'm not sure if I’m good enough to pursue a career in this field.",
            "Counselor": "Those feelings are valid. Have you thought about how to approach these goals in a way that feels manageable?",
            "Student": "Maybe breaking down the application process into smaller tasks could help.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like an excellent strategy! Taking it one step at a time can reduce anxiety. How do you feel about making a plan for that?",
            "Student": "I feel a little better knowing I can take it step by step. Thank you!"

            "Student": "Hi, I’m back. I attended a seminar on social advocacy and it didn’t go well.",
            "Counselor": "Welcome back, Priya! I’m here to listen. What happened at the seminar?",
            "Student": "I struggled to voice my ideas during the group discussion. My peers seemed so confident, while I just froze up.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds frustrating. How did that make you feel during and after the event?",
            "Student": "During the discussion, I felt embarrassed. Afterward, I overheard my friends talking about their internships, which really made me feel inadequate.",
            "Counselor": "It's understandable to feel disheartened in moments like that. Have you reached out to anyone for support after the seminar?",
            "Student": "I just kept it to myself. I don’t want to bother anyone with my feelings.",
            "Counselor": "It's common to feel that way, but sharing might lighten the burden. Would you consider talking to a friend about how you're feeling?",
            "Student": "I suppose I could. It might do me some good."

            "Student": "Hi, I wanted to share my experience volunteering at a local shelter.",
            "Counselor": "Hi Priya! I'm glad you're here. How did volunteering go?",
            "Student": "It was emotional. I met some young people there who were really passionate about advocacy, and I felt overshadowed.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Being around motivated individuals can evoke a lot of feelings. How did that experience impact you?",
            "Student": "Instead of feeling inspired, I felt discouraged. I kept comparing myself to them and questioning my own contributions.",
            "Counselor": "It’s common to have those thoughts, Priya. Have you had a chance to reflect on your own accomplishments?",
            "Student": "Not really. I guess I’ve been so focused on how I’m not measuring up that I forgot to celebrate my own progress.",
            "Counselor": "Observing your own growth can be powerful. What would help you to remember and acknowledge your contributions positively?"

            "Counselor": "Hi Priya! That’s great to hear. How did your conversation go?",
            "Student": "He was really supportive. I told him about my worries and he suggested looking for a mentor to guide me.",
            "Counselor": "That’s a wonderful idea! How do you feel about seeking mentorship?",
            "Student": "I think it's a good opportunity, but I’m worried that it might expose my insecurities further.",
            "Counselor": "It’s natural to feel that way, but remember, mentors are there to help you grow. What’s one small step you could take toward this?",
            "Student": "I could start by researching potential mentors in my field and reaching out to them.",
            "Counselor": "That sounds like a perfect first step! Taking action can help turn your anxieties into tangible progress. I’m here to support you whenever you need."
