            "Student": "I’m feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about the new semester in Mechanical Engineering.",
            "Counselor": "That’s completely normal! What’s making you feel anxious specifically?",
            "Student": "I’m excited about my classes and opportunities, but I’m worried about keeping up with the workload. It feels a bit overwhelming already.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Have you set any strategies to manage your time and commitments?",
            "Student": "Not really, I’m just trying to wing it. I don’t want to fall behind, but it’s starting to stress me out.",
            "Counselor": "That’s understandable. Let’s explore some time management techniques together to help you feel more in control."

            "Student": "I’ve been working late every night and avoiding social events. My friends have noticed, especially my buddy Ethan.",
            "Counselor": "It sounds like you’re withdrawing from connections that usually support you. How does that make you feel?",
            "Student": "I feel guilty for not being there for them, and I miss hanging out, but I convince myself that I need to focus on school.",
            "Counselor": "Finding a balance is essential, David. Could you set small time blocks for both study and fun? That might help reduce guilt."
