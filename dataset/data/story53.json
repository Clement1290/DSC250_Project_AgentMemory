            "Description": "With the deadline for submissions approaching, Maya becomes increasingly withdrawn, often spending late nights on her designs. She avoids social interactions and neglects her hobbies, like stargazing and playing piano. One evening, Leo, her younger brother, notices her distress and expresses concern, but Maya brushes him off, feeling ashamed of her struggles. Staring at her work, she feels paralyzed by self-criticism, unable to put her creative ideas into practice. The joy she once found in her art has been replaced by a looming sense of dread and hopelessness.",

Despite having poured her heart into her work, she feels unprepared and fearful of judgment. As she sets up her display, she encounters familiar faces, but her anxiety prevents her from engaging in casual conversations. During the exhibition, a visitor praises her design, but instead of feeling elated, she brushes it off with self-doubt. Afterward, Ella approaches her and emphasizes how great her work truly is, encouraging Maya to embrace her unique voice. While this support offers a glimmer of hope, Maya continues to grapple with her inner critic, unsure if she can overcome her fears.",
